	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	
	<p>The first of these pages were created in November 2015 but post dates are the date I first read the book, not the date the file was posted.  Some dates are speculative (books on the in-tray).  Many are as yet empty, to be gradually filled from emails and other sources. 
	
	Site to-do list includes adding:
	
	+ categories or tags for better indexing
	
	+ search facility
	
	
	<ul class="posts">

	  {% for post in site.posts %}
	    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> Â» <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
	  {% endfor %}
	</ul>
