<b>Margalit Fox</b> - _The Riddle of the Labyrinth. The quest to crack an ancient code and the uncovering of a lost civilisation._

A book in three parts about the discovery and deciphering of "Linear B", the script of the ancient Minoan civilisation at Knossos, Crete.

An immediate obstacle with this book is **Margalit Fox**'s florid, breathless writing style. In the Introduction she informs the reader that her day job is a writer of obituaries for the _New York Times_. It shows.  The rose-tinted outlook and an uncritical, even adoring, attitude doesn't do justice to the fascinating subject. The transition from short-form notices to a book-length treatment has not been a success.  There is plenty of repetition (for example we are told several times that just because Crete is now part of Greece, the Minoans were unrelated to the classical Greeks and came long before).  Some constructive editing would have made for a tighter book and one more enjoyable to read.

The three main characters in the story of these discoveries neatly map out the three parts of the book.

Part one belongs to the Victorian archaeologist **Arthur Evans** who in 1900 and the years following, discovered the clay tablets bearing the Linear B script in the ruins of a royal palace at Knossos.  **Evans**, despite being the doyen of British archaeology (or perhaps because of it), was evidently out of his depth in the decipherment game, and likely as an archaeologist too.  If his pivotal controlling position in Victorian archaelogy had been less dominating, he would probably have enlisted more methodical collaborators and achieved more.  As it is, he never got far in a 40-year effort to decode the script and had the conceit to rebuild the ruins at Knossos reflecting his own interpretation and inspiration as much as preserving the original architecture.  Perhaps that is how all archaelogy was done in those days?  A cynic might say the whirlwind 3-day dig of a _Time Team_ documentary is little different, but I think I detect some progress from adoration of past civilisations to a more measured respect.
