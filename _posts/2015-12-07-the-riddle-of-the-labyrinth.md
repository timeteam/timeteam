<b>Margalit Fox</b> - _The Riddle of the Labyrinth. The quest to crack an ancient code and the uncovering of a lost civilisation_

A book in 3 parts about the discovery and deciphering of "Linear B", the script of the ancient Minoan civilisation at Knossos, Crete.

An immediate obstacle with this book is **Margalit Fox**'s florid, breathless writing style.
