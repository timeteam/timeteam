The glitzy binding and short chapters give the initial impression that this is an arty sort of memoir that is light on content (ideas, information, novelty).  Persisting, I quickly realised that initiaL impressions were wrong, as is nearly always the case.  Which is why they are initial, or one could say prior(prior = before gaining information).  Such Basyesian thinking comes naturally to Walsh, although it never gets labelled as such by him.  The major force working against keeping going is the very tight binding which makes it especially difficult to hold the pages open long enough to read.  

By about one-third of the way into reading this, I had started accumulating a list of pros and cons, with the cons very limited.  It is a very worthwhile read.

### Cons
  * The tight binding.  Would be much better to read as an ebook and just put the printed copy on the shelf to look at.

### Pros
  *
