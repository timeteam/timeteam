Although based on actual historical events and people, this is still very much a novel.  On the face of it, **Agnes Magnúsdóttir**, co-accused of murder of two men, is the principal character whose story is slowly revealed.  However in my mind the harsh Iceland of the 1800s and Icelanders themselves overwhelmingly leave the most lasting impression.   In that spirit, a few notable observations on Iceland and Icelanders of the era are appropriate:

+ <font size="2">Nearly all Icelanders have been literate since about 1800 (as **Hannah Kent** tells us in closing). For comparison, Great Britain had about 53% of the population literate according to <A href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy/">Max Roser</A>. (I don't know of historical statistics for Australia)</font>
+ Capital punishment was abolished in Iceland in the   .In Australia the final execution took place in 1967 (accompanied by a level of outrage that was apparently expressed by the population of Iceland 140 years earlier).
