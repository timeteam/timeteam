<b>John Brockman</b> _Editor_ 2015. _This Idea Must Die. Scientific theories that are blocking progress_. New York: Harper Perennial. 567 pp.

***

No fewer that 175 chapters by an eclectic variety of scientists and other academics, novelists, publishers on scientific theories that are blocking progress.  These chapters were first published at the <a href="http://edge.org/"> Edge Foundation</a> web site where much similar material can be found and from which many dozens of new reading directions will emerge.  As with this book.

The likes of Lee Smolin, Max Tegmark and David Deutsch are included, but so are Alan Alda and Ian McEwan along with a host unknown to me.  It would be surprising if any single reader knew all the contributors, which gets the volume a big tick.

Chapters are typically 2-3 pages and very conducive to bed-time reading. 

More to come...
