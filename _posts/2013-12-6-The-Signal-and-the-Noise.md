Not as interesting as I initially hoped, but very interesting in parts.  A popular account of Bayesian reasoning (if that is not an oxymoron).  One of the telling conclusions was that people’s surveyed predictions about sharemarket outlook and economic confidence generally are highly inaccurate.  You are much better off doing the reverse of what “market confidence” would suggest.  [A Nature article on the same theme](http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130425/srep01684/full/srep01684.html#supplementary-information)  is of similar interest.
