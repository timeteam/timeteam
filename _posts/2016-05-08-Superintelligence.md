Initial reactions:<br>Chapter 1 is a short, thorough and very readable survey of the technical history up to now of artificial intelligence (AI) development. Chapter 2, similarly charts likely future paths.  The book has an impressively eclectic bibliography, so much so that every page threatens a potentially long diversion into multiple parallel reading threads.  The reader can only admire and envy an author who is on top of such a range of material.  Subsequent chapters discuss different forms that superintelligent AI might take (speed superintelligence, collective superintelligence, quality superintelligence) then proceed to discuss the timing and speed of a future intelligence explosion

Much more to come on that, elsewhere.  For the moment, and in the spirit of even-handedness, one advocate of the most plausible alternative to plate tectonics <a href="http://www.expansiontectonics.com/index1.html">is here</a> and <a href="http://www.skepticblog.org/2009/11/23/no-growing-earth-but-a-growing-problem-with-science-journalism/">the web abounds with many shrill responses from plate tectonics advocates</a>.
