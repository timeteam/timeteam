<b>Simon Singh</b> 2005. _Fermat's Last Theorem_ London: Harper Collins. 340 pp.

***

Not just a popular account of the efforts of multiple mathematicians to solve *Pierre de Fermat*'s last theorem, but, and for me primarily, a splendid introduction to the rarified atmosphere of mathematicians working on number theory. markup

Fermat's Last Theorem was more properly a conjecture, since from the time *Fermat* stated it in 1637 as a marginal annotation in an older text, and for the next 358 years, it remained unproven.  The Theorem states:

>there are no whole number solutions for the equation x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup>

>where n is any number greater than 2

(If n=2 then the Theorem is Pythagoras' Theorem: x<sup>2</sup> + Y<sup>2</sup> = z<sup>2</sup>.)
