Not just a popular account of the efforts of multiple mathematicians to solve *Pierre de Fermat*'s last theorem, but, and for me primarily, a splendid introduction to the rarified atmosphere of mathematicians working on number theory. markup

Fermat's Last Theorem was more properly a conjecture, since from the time *Fermat* stated it in 1637 as a marginal annotation in an older text, and for the next 358 years, it remained unproven.  The Theorem states:

>there are no whole number solutions for the equation 

>$ x^n^ + Y^n^ = z^n $

>where n is any number greater than 2

(If n=2 then the Theorem is Pythagoras' Theorem : $ x^2 + Y^2 = z^2 $ )
