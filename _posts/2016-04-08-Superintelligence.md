An ambitious bookk about a topic normally reserved for science fiction writers: Is it plausible that artificial intelligence (AI) could one day exceed human capabilities? What would be the consequences?  What should we do about it?  No doubt many would consider this should remain within the realm of science fiction. Not so long ago similar voices no doubt would have said the same about nuclear weapons, satellites, antibiotics, transplant surgery, humans walking the surface of the moon, the internet (the what?), smartphones.  

Clearly it these are serious questions worth asking (a view shared by the likes of **Bill Gates**, **Max Tegmark**, **Martin Rees**, **Elon Musk**).  **Bostrom**'s method is to think hard about the likely steps along the way, make cogent arguments about the issues and reach the most plausible conclusions.  The book has an impressively eclectic bibliography, so much so that nearly every page threatens a potentially long diversion into multiple parallel reading threads.  The reader can only admire and envy an author who is on top of such a range of material.  

<br>Chapter 1 is a short, thorough and very readable survey of the technical history up to now of AI development. Chapter 2, similarly charts likely future paths.  Subsequent chapters discuss different forms that superintelligent AI might take (speed superintelligence, collective superintelligence, quality superintelligence) then proceed to discuss the timing and speed of a future intelligence explosion.  These early chapters gradually accumulate the impression that although clearly deeply considered, nevertheless what is presented here are opinions, some better supported than others.  Most of these early chapters don't seem to arrive at a clear conclusion.  Could anyone? At least **Bostrom** is honest about it.

<p>Chapter 6 contemplates scenarios for takeover by a superintelligent AI ...

Much more to come on that, elsewhere.  For the moment, and in the spirit of even-handedness, one advocate of the most plausible alternative to plate tectonics <a href="http://www.expansiontectonics.com/index1.html">is here</a> and <a href="http://www.skepticblog.org/2009/11/23/no-growing-earth-but-a-growing-problem-with-science-journalism/">the web abounds with many shrill responses from plate tectonics advocates</a>.
