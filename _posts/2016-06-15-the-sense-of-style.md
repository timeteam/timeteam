<b>Steven Pinker</b> 2015. _The Sense of Style. The thinking person's guide to writing in the 21st century_.  London: Allen Lane. 359 pp.

Despite the title, not a style guide, but certainly a guide to writing.  Much to be learned here.  To live on any writer's desk (along with _Fowler's Modern English Usage_ **Stephen Murray-Smith**'s _Right Words_ and **Huddleston** & **Pullum**'s _A Student's Introduction to English Grammar_.

Haven't read it all, more of a reference (as the author himself advises).
