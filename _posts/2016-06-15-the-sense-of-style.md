Despite the title, not a style guide, but certainly a guide to writing.  Much to be learned here.  To live on any writer's desk, along with  _Fowler's Modern English Usage_, **Stephen Murray-Smith**'s _Right Words_ and **Huddleston** & **Pullum**'s _A Student's Introduction to English Grammar_.

Haven't read it all, more of a reference (as the author himself advises).  

Not without faults.  Indeed I found Chapter 4 _The web, the tree, and the string_ totally impenetrable.  A damning criticism of a book which claims to be a guide to clarity in writing.  Yet I couldn't come to grips with the extensive use of branching tree diagrams to explain relationships between grammatical elements in sentences.  Perhaps it was me; I might try again one day.  I could have done with some comments on hyphenation ("sea-level" or "sea level"?  "saltwater", "salt-water" or "salt water"?).  But _hyphen_ does not even appear in the index.

Highlights so far include the valuable advice, well and truly taken on board, not to over-use pointers: "this is what the previous paragraph was about" and "this is what the next paragraph is about" or even "this is what this paragraph is about".  Instead, just say it! Also the timely criticism of the increasingly widespread and very irritating incorrect use of apostrophes, often with ludicrous results.    And his advice not to get hung up about split infinitives, lest one write nonsense such as "I'm moving to France not to get fat".  There are numerous other examples of how not to write (a rich field, admittedly) which makes for highly amusing reading. I daresay **Stephen Pinker** (should he read this paragraph) would (if he could be bothered) advise me not to over-do parentheses.

Chapter 6 _Telling right from wrong. How to make sense of the rules of correct grammar, word choice, and punctuation_ is the most valuable.  Full of instructions on correct and incorrect usage and to be consulted regularly.  If only it could be made compulsory reading for serial offenders such as sports commentators and authors or retail signs and newsletters.
