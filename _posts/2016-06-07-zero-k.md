This could be considered as near future science fiction, except that the science is hardly there at all and the fiction is so sparely written that there is hardly enough of it to clasify as fiction or non-fiction.

The protagonist, listless Manhattan son Jeffrey, his wealthy tycoon father Ross, and his stepmother Anita (archaeologist, now terminally ill), revolve around one another in only mildly disfunctional relationships that gradually become closer as first Anita, then Ross, gravitate towards cryogenic preservation.  The cryogenic facility is in Chelyabinsk where a dystopian architectural vision has been realised in order to prepare the patients for a life that is eternal, but evidently post-human.  Or perhaps sub-human.  While in the vat, awaiting medical and scientific advances that will allow cures and re-animation, the patients retain a whisker of conciousness thanks to pharmacology and nanotechnology which are unspecified; **DeLillo** has no need of such menial matters. Son Jeffrey politely rejects the offer of such an eternal (but unproven) future, although it is only with the last words of the novel that **DeLillo** allows him to finally declare his hand.
