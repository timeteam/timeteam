>*Nineveh, in Mesopotamia, was one of the great cities of antiquity, and has an archaeological history dating from at least 3000 BC.  After 637 AD it was replaced by Mosul, which is on the opposite bank of the Tigris River, in modern day Iraq.  Numerous sackings and wars over many centuries left Nineveh in ruins, the modern battle by rival Islamic groups for Mosul is only the latest.) <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineveh">Nineveh (Wikipedia)</A>.
