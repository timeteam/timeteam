In 1872 an Assistant at the British Museum, **George Smith**, discovered the story of the Flood, more or less as described in the Book of Genesis, inscribed in cuneiform on a clay table found in Nineveh.  The story of the Flood was known to the Assyrians and Babylonians more than a thousand years before the Bible.  The Old Testament scooped by an even older clay testament.  However, many questions remained unanswered, including how and when the story of the Flood was first told.  **Irving Finkel** fills some of these gaps with the discoveries arising from decoding a another cuneiform tablet, dating from about 1750- BC, brought to **Finkel** at the British Museum by a private owner.  _The Ark Before Noah_ tells the story.

The first few chapters are about cuneiform script and the languages that used it, the people who wrote and read it, various iterations of the flood story, and about the new Ark tablet.  These are perhaps the most interesting parts of the book.  Cuneiform script was used (mainly) by two languages: Sumerian (the older language) left no descendant languages.   Akkadian led to, or at least influenced, Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic.  The <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi">The Code of Hammurabi</A> is written in Akkadian.  Both Sumerian and Akkadian had no living users by the  time of the Romans.  Their decoding was a modern puzzle.  The first use of written language was not to write early sonnets praising the beauty of sunsets, but to keep a tally of assets and document taxes. A vast number of tablets have been retrieved from Mesopotamia (130,000; most still unread since the time of their creation), and evidently enough are dated, or at least arranged chronologically, to observe the evolution of the language, for example co-opting of nouns for specific items to serve more abstract purposes, for example indefinite articles.  

Thus, Akkadian fairly quickly evolved into a rich language from which we know much about the Babylonians.  ... 

Cuneiform cannot be written with the left hand (which would erase the preceding marks), probably explaining much subsequent attempted retraining, alienation and persecution of left-handed people in more recently derived languages. 

**Irving Finkel** has a Zen attitude to cuneiform that is impossible not to warm to; in some sense he sees cuneiform as not really there at all, just a gap left in the clay by an ancient author, meaning derived not from the mark itself, but the shadow it casts.

><A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineveh">Nineveh</A>, in Mesopotamia, was one of the great cities of antiquity, and has an archaeological history dating from at least 3000 BC.  After 637 AD it was replaced by Mosul, which is on the opposite bank of the Tigris River, in modern day Iraq.  Numerous sackings and wars over many centuries left Nineveh in ruins, the modern battle by rival Islamic groups for Mosul is only the latest.).
