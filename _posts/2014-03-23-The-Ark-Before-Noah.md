In 1872 an Assistant at the British Museum, **George Smith**, discovered the story of the Flood, more or less as described in the Book of Genesis, inscribed in cuneiform on a clay table found in Nineveh*.  The story of the Flood was known to the Assyrians and Babylonians more than a thousand years before the Bible.  The Old Testament scooped by an even older clay testament.  However, many questions remained unanswered, including how and when the story of the Flood was first told.  **Irving Finkel** fills some of these gaps with discovery and decoding of a new  cuneiform tablet brought to him at the British Museum.  _The Ark Before Noah_ tells the story.

><A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineveh">*Nineveh</A>, in Mesopotamia, was one of the great cities of antiquity, and has an archaeological history dating from at least 3000 BC.  After 637 AD it was replaced by Mosul, which is on the opposite bank of the Tigris River, in modern day Iraq.  Numerous sackings and wars over many centuries left Nineveh in ruins, the modern battle by rival Islamic groups for Mosul is only the latest.).
