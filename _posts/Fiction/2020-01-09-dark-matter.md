Thriller with veneer of SF in which the "many worlds" theory of quantum physics is exploited to allow the protagonist to explore alternate worlds with alternate histories and his alternate selves.  Not as developed or polished as [Recursion](http://timeteam.github.io/fiction/2019/11/17/recursion.html) and I thought the main character's wife and son were thinly and improbably painted, reappearing at the end to immediately and unquestioningly swallow a many worlds quantum story and act on it.  Lee Child liked it though.
