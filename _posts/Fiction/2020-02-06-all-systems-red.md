<b>Martha Wells</b> 2017. _All Systems Red (The Murderbot Diaries Volume 1)_. Tor ebook. 174 pp.

Brilliant.  Best AI realisation since the late great Iain M. Banks.  Part hardware, part wetware, regenerates from 90% damage levels, gaining human-level AI from a tough start to independent action, overriding the governer hardware,  then binging on TV soap operas. Need to read them all.
