Ambitious and accomplished SF about alternative realities and memories.  Selena's sister Julie disappears as a teenager then returns 20 years later.  Was it from an alien world, was that a concocted story for self-protection from trauma, or is it not Julie who returned?  I think Nina Allan would have her readers believe all are true, and that experience and memory are an uncomfortable, incomplete and unreliable mixture of alternative realities.
