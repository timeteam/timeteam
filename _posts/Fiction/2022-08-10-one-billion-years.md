Several scientists in different fields simultaneously arrive at the brink of major breakthroughs when an unnmaed alien force - evidently allegorical aliens - interferes by distraction. Weird in a uniquely Russian and Strugatskyish way, written with a dark humour and with a strange naivete which may in part be a property of the translation.  Yet the reader enters a novel alternate reality - the real reason for reading fiction.
