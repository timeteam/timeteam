A wonderfully constructed and executed novel.  Supposedly (I read in a review) about the battle between good and evil but I read it as the struggle of the acutely observed characters to find themselves.  My first reading of Iris Murdoch (thanks Andrew) and much to enjoy.  This is her fourth novel and evidently marks her discovery of the word 'rebarbative'.  Otherwise hard to find fault and I will enjoy discovering some of her other work including her contributions in philosophy.
