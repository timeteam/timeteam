Probably the best example yet in the niche SF genre where terraformed planets come to be dominated by civilisations of highly intelligent jumping spiders and stomatopods.

Actually, pretty good, especially in the realisation of the war against entropy in space flight over gigantic intervals of time.  And also of the degraded consciousness of an AI left marooned for aeons.
