Anthony Horowitz has got the gang back together.  A more than passable addition to the Arthur Conan Doyle canon, and an enjoyable romp. It would be fun to offer up this text, along with the originals, to machine learning software and see if the outlier can be classified.  Perhaps there are greater differences between early and late authentic Conan Doyle texts?

In the course of providing historical colour, Horowitz accidentally draws attention to an interesting aside about London population demographics.  London already had a population of some 6 million about 1900 (about double the populations of Paris or New York at that time), and has [fluctuated between 6 and 8 million for the last 120 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_London#Population).
