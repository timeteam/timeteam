An admirer has compared Gerald Murnane with Beckett but more like Proust than anything I have read, and even more introspective, withdrawn.  Accomplished and assured language but riven with minutiae and recursion which ascends from device to distraction to annoyance.  

>I feel that there is much to be said for the Celtic belief that the souls of those whom we have lost are held captive in some inferior being, in an animal, in a plant, in some inanimate object, and thus effectively lost to us until the day (which to many never comes) when we happen to pass by the tree or to obtain posession of the object which forms their prison ... and as soon as we have recognised them the spell is broken.  Delivered by us, they have overcome death and return to share our life.
