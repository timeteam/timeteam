<b>Ted Chiang</b> 2013. _Stories of Your Life and Others_. Picador ebook. 352 pp.

Notable because the fourth story in this SF collection is _Story of your life_, which formed the basis for the film _Arrival_. 

The first story, _Tower of Babylon_,  is a re-imagining of the Tower of Babylon as if by **Borges**.  In this parallel world the tower is being built over many generations and now reaches the border of Heaven.  Miners ascend (a 4 month journey) to tunnel up to discover what lies there.  But it is something of a Möbius tower, or rather the world itself and reality is of different inimaginable geometry and dimensions in this parable.  

_Understand_ is a page-turner narrative of a patient with brain damage from a near-drowning.  Thanks to a new drug he is not only repaired but made mentally superhuman, vastly superior to the doctors and CIA who created him and who are left in the dust.  But there is one other such.

_Division by zero_ invents a mathematician who is discombobulated to discover a truth in the spirit of Kurt Gödel: mathematics contains an inherent contradiction.  But there is an unsatisfactory end (or rather none). More likely I didn't get it.

_Story of your life_ ...

_Seventy-two letters_ ...

_The evolution of human science_ ...

_Hell is the absence of God_ ...

_Liking what you see: a documentary_ ...

There are some slightly interesting story notes at the end of the volume
