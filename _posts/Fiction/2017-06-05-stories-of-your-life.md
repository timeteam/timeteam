Sought this out because of the fourth story in this SF collection, _Story of your life_, which formed the basis for the film _Arrival_. 

The first story, _Tower of Babylon_,  is a re-imagining of the Tower of Babylon as if by **Borges**.  In this parallel fantastical world the tower is being built over many generations and now reaches the border of the dome of Heaven.  Miners ascend (a 4 month journey) to tunnel up to discover what lies there.  But it is something of a Möbius tower, or rather the world itself and reality is of different inimaginable geometry and dimensions in this parable.  

_Understand_ is a page-turner narrative of a patient with brain damage from a near-drowning.  Thanks to a new drug he is not only repaired but made mentally superhuman, vastly superior to the doctors and CIA who created him and who are left in the dust.  But there is one other such.

_Division by zero_ invents a mathematician who is discombobulated to discover a truth in the spirit of Kurt Gödel: mathematics contains an inherent contradiction.  But there is an unsatisfactory end (or rather none). More likely I didn't get it.

_Story of your life_ The movie _Arrival_ is both less and more than the story.  More, because the movie has a stronger narrative.  Less, because what seems the central idea of the story, that the alien's language is what awakens an element of timelessness in the conciousness of the linguist, is not a focus of the movie.

_Seventy-two letters_ ...

_The evolution of human science_ ...

_Hell is the absence of God_ ...

_Liking what you see: a documentary_ ...

The enduring impression from this collection of stories is while the ideas are interesting, they are not backed up by strong writing.  Like so much SF, but especially short stories where the "thought experiment" theme seems to satisfy the author who doesn't bother with the discipline required to turn that idea into a memorable piece of writing.  SF novels, at least the modern ones, seem not to suffer this problem to the same degree. 

There are some slightly interesting story notes at the end of the volume.
