Notable because the fourth story in this SF collection is _Story of your life_, which formed the basis for the film _Arrival_. 

The first story, _Tower of Babylon_,  is a re-imagining of the Tower of Babylon as if by **Borges**.  In this parallel world the tower is being built over many generations and now reaches the border of Heaven.  Miners ascend (a 4 month journey) to tunnel up to discover what lies there.  But it is something of a MÃ¶bius tower, or rather the world itself and reality is of different inimaginable geometry and dimensions in this parable.
