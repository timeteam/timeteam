A ridiculously Hollywood storyline narrated in first person in such twee style that could almost be later day Enid Blyton.  Read the first 50 pages to get the cloying flavour then the last few to see the indulgent ending Andy Weir chooses for his interstellar voyaging physicist/science teacher. What heroically uncritical audience is this aimed at?
