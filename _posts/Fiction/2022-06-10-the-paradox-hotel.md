The house detective in the "airport hotel" of a time travel tourism facility is falling to bits mentally (known side-effect of too much time travel)  while trying to solve mystery crimes, some of which might not have happened yet or may not happen.  And while being visited by her dead lover.  Amid a conference of corporates bidding to buy the time travel facility. With a couple of smuggled dinosaurs on the loose.  Lots of ideas, played with in style.  Fun read.
