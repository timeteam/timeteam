<b>Kim Stanley Robinson</b> 2015. _Aurora_.  London: Orbit.  466 pp.

***

A multi-generation, 160 year voyage in which 2,000 humans aboard a ship travelling at one tenth light speed aim to colonise a nearby star system. Doesn't go well.  As well as being a cracking good yarn this is also: 
 - an exploration of how the personalities of the characters marure from childhood to adults; 
 - about the  maturation of the AI in the ship's quantum computer  (a touch of the flavour of _Flowers for Algernon_) under human tuition; 
 - then Also about governing and failure when democracies turn to civil war (watch for this when delusional Trump supporters react to impeachment);

Interesting choices made by **Kim Stanley Robinson** in this future.  Interstellar travel technology has marched way ahead of AI, or of nanotechnology, to name just a few. The author also allows himself some introspective ruminations of an author who allows the ship, while writing the narrative of the journey, so philosophise that consciousness is just what a being does, ie produce a narrative/novel.
