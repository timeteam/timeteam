A kind of Bonfire of the Vanities tale of self-inflicted descent into chaos of a little-known composer who is also an amateur molecular biologist.  The reason for this improbable element only becomes evident at the very end.  Starts out feeling a bit of a febrile autobiography but somehow becomes more compelling as the story becomes more improbable.  If for no other reason, with it for the musical accounts of the most famous works of Schostakovich and, especially, Olivier Messiaen, and their historical context, which I thought I knew but not well enough.
