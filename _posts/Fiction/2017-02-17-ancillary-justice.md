Top-notch science fiction.  As with **Iain M. Banks**' Culture novels, here the starships are also artifical intelligences (although they lack the wit of **Banks**' creations).  But **Ann Leckie** does more to explore the possibilities of various intelligences: human, alien, artificial, and hybrids between them. These are typically distributed across multiple networked bodies (which would be handy). The components that the ship intelligences distribute themselves across are now-dead human bodies that have been co-opted to the cause of the dominant race, the Radch and are thawed out into service when required.  But intelligences networked across many widely-distributed bodies can splinter into separate entities.  A conspiracy plot develops mid-novel and civil war threatens between components of the controlling networked human ruler.  The central character of the novel, the revenge-driven ship-mind (now confined to a single body) becomes less confident of his/her independence, free will, memory, independence.  Just like the human mind then.

This novel seems to have elements that indicate a female author, or maybe it is just that the style recalls something of **Margaret Attwood** and **Ursula K. LeGuin**: intricate inter-personal politics are a bit convoluted for this simple male reader; gender of the characters is ambiguous and barely relevant; sex is a background activity and seems usually between the same gender (except that humans have long since moved on from trivial limitations like "homosexual"); jewellery and clothes demand careful choice and are plenty significant in Radch society, while technical topics hardly rate a mention (cf. [**Neal Stephenson**](http://timeteam.github.io/fiction/2015/07/07/Seveneves.html) and [**Ian McDonald**](http://timeteam.github.io/fiction/2016/01/15/Luna.html), just for a couple of recent examples).
