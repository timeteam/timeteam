As with **Iain M. Banks**' Culture novels, here the starships are also artifical intelligences (although they lack the wit of **Banks**' creations).  But **Ann Leckie** does more to explore the possibilities of various intelligences: human, alien, artificial. And distributed across multiple bodies (since the ship and other intelligences can distribute themselves across many once-human bodies that have been co-opted to the cause of the dominant race, the Radch.  But intelligences networked across many widely-distributed bodies can splinter into separate entities.  As a conspiracy plot develops mid-novel, the ship-mind that is the central character becomes less confident of it's independence, free will, and it's components (often in conflict).  Just like the human mind then.

This novel seems to have elements that indicate a female author, or maybe it is just that the style recalls something of **Margaret Attwood** and **Ursula K. LeGuin**: intricate inter-personal politics are a bit convoluted for this simple male reader; gender of the characters is ambiguous and barely relevant; sex is a background activity and seems usually between the same gender (except that humans have long since moved on from trivial limitations like "homosexual"); jewellery and clothes demand careful choice and are plenty significant in society, while technical topics hardly rate a mention (cf. [**Neal Stephenson**](http://timeteam.github.io/fiction/2015/07/07/Seveneves.html) and [**Ian McDonald**](http://timeteam.github.io/fiction/2016/01/15/Luna.html), just for a couple of recent examples).
