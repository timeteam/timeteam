Chose to read this on the basis of a review in a mathematics journal but there is no mathematics in the novel, you would learn as much about beekeeping. A well-crafted example of 2nd-tier crime fiction.  For a novel written in covid lockdown, I found it disturbing that all Louise Penny's characters of dubious or criminal intent are academics.  Even a cameo by an archaeologist.  Perhaps I was unlucky in my choice of novel, maybe next time she will trash beekeepers.  On the other hand, she has golden retrievers.
