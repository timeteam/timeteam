It seems Haruki Murakami sums this up himself at the end, using the voice of Oshima, a character of uncertain gender who  might be his alter-ego:

    > "Every one of us is losing something precious ... but ... you'll live for ever in your own private library"
    
There is enough metaphor of life and loss for anyone to find a way to relate to the fantastic story where reality takes a minor role.
