It seems Haruki Murakami sums this up himself at the end, using the voice of Oshima, a character of uncertain gender who  might be his alter-ego:

    > "Every one of us is losing something precious ... 
    but ... 
    you'll live for ever in your own private library"
    

Appearances by talking cats, and spirit-form  Johnny Walker of whisky fame and Coloney Sanders of fried chicken fame betray an immature touch and don't give a lot of hope but it is worth pushing on.  It is about whatever you want as long as it is in the line of dual personalities/existences/lives/worlds.  There is enough metaphor here for anyone to find a way to relate to the fantastic story where reality takes a minor role.  With fewer immature spirit forms and a bit less of the post-war American-influenced and scarred Japan it would have been a more timeless and greater work of fiction.  As it is, a creditable attempt.
