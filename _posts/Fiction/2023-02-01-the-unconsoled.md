Ishiguro's masterpiece.  Here is his most sustained, Dosteovesky-like work. An extraordinary dream-like narrative which leaves the reader in doubt over what remains when memories and subjective awareness can't be trusted (in other words, always).  _The Buried Giant_ carries this forward in a shorter more elegant narrative in a prehistoric setting but _The Unconsoled_ is the more powerful both for the familiar setting and for being a longer more immersive experience.  An author who can write this can write anything.
