Subversive, disturbing, mysterious fiction, a re-imagining of SF.  Perhaps some sort of hybrid of Patrick White and Kurt Vonnegut, with more than a touch of the Cave of Forgotten Dreams.  Turns the squalor of cheap inner London and desolate country into a horror landscape of undercurrents from which various aquatic forms slowly and fleetingly emerge, or are alluded to: by turn mysteriously slimy, embryonic, proto-human by turn. The meanings are ambiguous but in one sense the undercurrent forms which intrude are perhaps the qualities, or capabilities, that the two characters (Shaw and Victoria - verbally disabled, almost mute) are missing in their lives and relationship.  I was uncertain for much of the novel if the author could bring the depressing and ambiguous threads into some sort of confluence (clearly no resolution was on offer).  But the end did achieve a powerful resolution, despite or because of the ambiguity.   

If one were to dare criticism, Harrison's sentences are so good they are almost a distraction.  Are they his deliberate and personal smoke-screen?   

And wonderful to find that the similarly mysterious _Dendrogramma_ makes a cameo appearance!  Though only a bit-player it nevertheless forms a strangely appropriate part of the subliminal pseudo-science wordscape. Along with genetics, Denisovans, geology and other allusions.

Also wonderful to find my high expectations (based on some early reviews) to be far exceeded, so much so I struggle to recall any novel post- Patrick White that is as impressive.
