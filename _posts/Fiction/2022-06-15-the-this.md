His previous _The Thing Itself_, I thought was pretty good - a SF-realisation of the philosophy of Kant.  

This attempt at doing the same for Hegel is unreadably clever and complicated.  It seems the target audience is students in his 19th Century Literature classes at London University.  The first 50 pages has a parallel text running on the bottom third of each page - some sort of social media styled stream of consciousness.  Maybe it could have become approachable after that but I couldn't be bothered.  Would rather read about Hegel more directly - no doubt that would be difficult enough.
