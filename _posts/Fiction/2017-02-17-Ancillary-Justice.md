As with **Iain M. Banks**' Culture novels, here the starships are also artifical intelligences (although they lack the wit of **Banks**' creations).  But **Ann Leckie** does more to explore the possibilities of various intelligences: human, alien, artificial. And distributed across multiple bodies (since the ship and other intelligences can distribute themselves across many once-human bodies that have been co-opted to the cause of the dominant race, the Radch.  But intelligences networked across many widely-distributed bodies can splinter into separate entities.  As a conspiracy plot develops mid-novel, the ship-mind that is the central character becomes less confident of it's independence, free will, and components.  Just like the human mind then, as **Marvin Minsky** convincingly asserts.
