This extraordinary little conceit (as the author himself describes it), is a thought experiment: what if a priest in Mesopotamia discovered a naturally-occuring rock that looked like cuneiform writing (but, being inorganic in origin, was inintelligible)?  Irving Finkel of the British Museum indulges himself in a story making use of this theme.  Since he is an authority on Mesopotamian language and writing, and has a beard to match, he should be qualified.  And maybe he is, but if so, the Mesopotamians who he has spent a lifetime studying were even more odd than Irving Finkel.
