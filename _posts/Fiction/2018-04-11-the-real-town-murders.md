<img align="right" src="https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/assets/OrionPublishingGroup/img/book/475/isbn9781473221475.jpg" alt="">  Ostensibly a murder mystery set in a future London, really this is an opportunity for Adam Roberts to show off some ideas (about a near future where government departments war against each other for a more complete control of society) and offer various mildly witty puns on future uses of words and concepts.  To get a feel for the flavour: this is a future where where great figures in British history have their visages carved into thw chalk cliffs of Dover, where the internet has become a convincing "Second Life" virtual environment much more desireable than the "Real".  In the impoverished Real, the Vauxhall Astra (if you can find one) is a classic car and faster than anything else on the road.

I've read reviewers that claim each Adam Roberts novel is different, but having read two there are common elements: his ideas, admittedly original and adventurous, are nevertheless thinly  painted, as do his characters.  They thus remain unconvincing vehicles on which to hang a story that drags the reader into a new world-view and uses it to fully explore those ideas in the way that the best SF should -- cf. Iain M. Banks or Greg Egan, for example.  For me, two Adam Roberts novels will probably suffice.
