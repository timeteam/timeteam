An easy target given that the present is already enough of a dystopia.  Along the way there are various mildly witty allusions, and puns on future uses of words, historical events and the like.  To get a feel for the flavour: this is a future where where great figures in British history have their visages carved into the chalk cliffs of Dover, where the internet has become a convincing "Second Life" virtual environment much more desirable than the "Real".  In the impoverished Real, the Vauxhall Astra (if you can find one) is a classic car and faster than anything else on the road.

I've read reviewers who claim each Adam Roberts novel is different, but having read two there are common elements: his ideas, admittedly original and adventurous, are nevertheless thinly  painted, as are his characters.  They thus remain unconvincing vehicles on which to hang a story that drags the reader into a new world-view and uses it to fully explore those ideas in the way that the best SF should -- cf. Iain M. Banks or Greg Egan, for a couple of examples.  

For me, two Adam Roberts novels will probably suffice.
