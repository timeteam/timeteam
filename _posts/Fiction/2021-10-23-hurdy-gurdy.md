Supposedly a black comedy, according to [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/05/hurdy-gurdy-by-christopher-wilson-review-brisk-black-comedy) which just goes to show that even the best sources aren't uniformly reliable. A narrative of a young priest who unwittingly spreads the bubonic plague by sharing his fleas.  Full of clever little witicisms and commentary but I found it unfunny and pointless.
