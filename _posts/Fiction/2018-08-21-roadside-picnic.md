> Goodness ... You got to make it out of badness ... Because there isn't anything else to make it out of.  

Aliens have had a roadside picnic when they passed this way.  Their landing areas are the dangerous Zones, managed by a beauracracy attempting control and a black market attempting vast profit. Their occasionally useful but technologically incomprehensible litter is the basis of this pathological economy in a bleak society in a nameless country with very human characters.  A parable.  The Zones might be capitalism, or some other -ism, or perhaps even Dante's inferno.  The postscript on the tribulations of publishing in pre-peristroika Russia, by the surviving author Boris, suggests it is just an ideology-free tale on the struggle of life.
