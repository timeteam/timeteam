> Goodness ... You got to make it out of badness ... Because there isn't anything else to make it out of.  

Aliens have had a roadside picnic on their way through.  Their landing areas are the dangerous Zones, managed by a beauracracy attempting control and a black market attempting vast profit. Their occasionally useful but technologically incomprehensible litter is the basis of this pathological economy in a bleak society in a nameless country with very human characters.  In this parable the Zones might be capitalism, or some other -ism, or perhaps even Dante's inferno.  Or, as suggested in the postscript by the surviving author Boris, don't over-analyse just treat it as an ideology-free tale on the struggle of life.  Boris' documentary evidence of the mindless idiocy of the censors, more stylistic than ideological, in pre-peristroika Russia is breathtaking.  Kafka passed this way.
