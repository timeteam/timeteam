<b>Ian McDonald</b> 2017. _Luna. Wolf moon_. London: Gollancz. 382 pp.

***

**Ian McDonald** returns to his near future world where family corporations war on and for a moon where there are no laws or enforcement, just power.  As with the first novel _Luna_, the world creation is compelling, but although it is a wild ride in the end it seems a bit derivative and there is no greater idea or vision being served.  Like _Game of Thrones_, full of gratuitous violence and sex but empty of any meaning (unless this is an extended parable warning of the end-point of free markets - a return to brutal medieval world).  Apparently there will be a third volume, which will be more than enough.  And a television adaptation is also evidently in production.  Bound to appeal widely.
