A fabulous prose writer, which however does not compensate for the deeply flawed characters and tragic trajectory of the narrative. (One can only wonder at the ghastly novel he might write today - Updike's dreadful middle America of the 1960s would be a paradise anyone would grasp at if the alternative was being dumped back into the America of the Trump era.) 

Nevertheless, the net result is no desire at all to explore Rabbit's world further.
