<b>James Bradley</b> 2015. _Clade_.  Australia: Penguin. 239 pp.

***

Dysfunctional personal relationships, increasingly  severe climate change disasters on a global scale, illnesses and deaths first among main characters then as global epidemic, deaths of species, refugee movement from ecological disasters on vast scales, near collapse of human civilisation.  Readers who delight in these things and such all-to-believable near future scenarios should dive right in.  Only in the last 20 pages do some traces of hard sf, and hope, intrude.  You have been warned.

Most of all, not imaginative enough to consider satisfying sf. Its very plausibility - no original ideas, everything here is already in the mind of many a conservationist - is the downfall of this well written novel.  Not a bad book, if you like that sort of thing.
