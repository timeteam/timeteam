I think the reason I've been seeking this is due to mentions by researchers in AI and consciousness research.  Or perhaps just in lists of classic SF, to which this surely belongs.

The Faustian character Frist is an AI in a world where humans [man] are long extinct.  Frost seeks to understand man, to become one.  Allusions drawn from The Bible and from Goethe, as explained in the splendidly terse and informative [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_a_Breath_I_Tarry). A strength is that much is left unexplained.  This is a reminder that many of the great themes and ideas in science fiction date from the 1950s and 1960s.  

> Now - for a breath I tarry /  Nor yet disperse apart - / Take my hand quick and tell me, / What have you in your heart. [from A.E. Houseman, A Shorshire Lad]
