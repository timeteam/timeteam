Proper hard science fiction.  A bleak vision of the future which revolves around a fully worked demonstration of the idea that intelligence (and evolutionary success) does not imply or require conscious self-awareness.  But did the author have to make it such a challenging read?  I guess so, just to qualify for club membership.
