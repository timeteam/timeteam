I found myself thinking of this as a forensic examination of human emotions and relationships, a kind of microscopical study of humanity and a natural partner to the vast historical (macroecological?) scope of _War and Peace_.  Together you could say they pretty much cover the entire shooting match.

Tolstoy seemed to me to make a point of rehabilitating Vronsky during the 4 years of writing.  And the autobiographical Levin is easy to relate to.  Although easy to read, often hard to put down, an 8 course banquet like this takes away the appetite for further reading for a while.
