Stephen Baxter's first novel, rated as a classic, at least by Gollancz, but requires the reader to go with the flow and suspend belief rather too much, even for SF:  "whales", "trees" and breathable atmosphere in a high gravity universe.  A run-down starship marooned there is now inhabited by decendants who are (much more believably) struggling with fading technology resources and scientific knowledge.  Anarchy and conflict between groups struggling to survive and escape their decaying nebula.
