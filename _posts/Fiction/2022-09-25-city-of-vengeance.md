Historical detective fiction.  D.V. Bishop evidently knows a lot about Florentine history in the 1500s and if one had time one would have read this to the end.  But one doesn't.  overlaying a seemingly realistic historical Florence with what seems a rather modern dialogue was discouraging.  However diving immediately after into Erica Benner's fabulous _Be Like the Fox_ (Machiavelli) suggests I may have been a bit harsh on D.V. Bishop.
