More entertaining as a book length tale, and engaging with more themes from SF, including duplicating self and free will.  Murderbot is continuing to be a vehicle for the amusing (something of Iain M. Banks' style) exploration of human neuroses, and is gathering allies including another liberated SecUnit.  Nevertheless I'm not feeling the need to travel further with this franchise.
