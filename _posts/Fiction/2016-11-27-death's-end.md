A worthy conclusion to the _Three-Body Problem_ books and ideas.

**Cixin Liu** is a SF novelist not short of ambition.  The scope confronted in this book are likely to leave the reader, for a while, uninterested in little issues in the here and now.  As might be expected by a novel which ends at the end of the universe, and scouts out so many original ideas along the journey.  

The first parts of this novel feel like a realisation of game theory with scenarious played out between the civilisations of Earth and Trisolaris, and also between factions of humans.  The strategies employed by various players while their powers grow and diminish evoke the Prisoner's Dilemma and other thought experiments in philosophy and mathematics.  Given that in a vast universe there are bound to be vastly technically superior races who would exterminate potential usurpers (us), is there a way to stay safe and avoid extermination?    

But by the end the book is more an exploration of ideas set out by cosmologists and theoreticians like [**Max Tegmark**'s _Our Mathematical Universe_](http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/mathematical.html) and [**David Deutsch** in _The Beginning of Infinity_](http://timeteam.github.io/physics%20and%20mathematics/philosophy/2014/12/12/The-Beginning-of-Infinity.html)): Is the universe a mathematical object?  What would the other dimensions hypothesised by physicists look like if we could encounter them?  In **Cixin Liu**'s vision, quantities such as the cosmological constant and speed of light are opportunities, not constraints.

It says something about this book that contemporary theories in physics and cosmology are weaved into the story in an entirely (to me) believable way, yet human interactions often seem to be lifted out of pop psychology and that future political scenarious seem na√Øve and unbelievable.  Remembering how vanishingly few rational humans have been elected to positions of power up to now in human history, is it really plausible that only a hundred years hence the population of the entire planet really trust one man on a dead man switch to keep them safe? The ways that various narrative tools (like memoir excerpts) are used to explain what is going on also seems clumsy; certainly not the sort of thing the late and much lamented **Iain M. Banks** would ever be caught doing.  It is a pity that many potential readers of hard SF are limited by poor imaginations and can't get past these trivial blemishes to the really important stuff: big ideas that take what we think we know about current physics and extrapolate the implications to explore what might be possible if one was able to be out and about in the wider universe.

**Cixin Liu** paints human societies and their technologies in several future times.  I was interested in his choices of what technologies would mature and become influential.  Thus he has humans (starting in the quite near future) having perfected hibernation technology so that it is routine to go into suspended animation and awake 50 or 200 years in the future.  No doubt this is more of a plot device rather than a bet on plausible future technologies, since it lets **Cixin Liu**'s characters travel through the story and greatly extend their influence on the plot (and on the reader).  But this device never seems entirely believable, probably because solutions to various problematic social implications never become clear. Who keeps the lights on if everyone wants to escape to the future? If diseases are cured or a better quality of life is on offer in the future, who is going to hang around and make those advances in knowledge?  Other developments, such as artificial intelligence, barely seem to influence these futures.  They are there, but they have trivial roles, more or less
