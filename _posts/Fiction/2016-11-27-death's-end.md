A worthy conclusion to the _Three-Body Problem_ books and ideas.

**Cixin Liu** is a SF novelist not short of ambition.  The scope confronted in this book are likely to leave the reader, for a while, uninterested in little issues in the here and now.  As might be expected by a novel which ends at the end of the universe, and scouts out so many original ideas along the journey.  The first parts of this novel feel like a realisation of game theory with scenarious played out between human and tri-solaris civilisation, and also between factions of humans.  The strategies employed by various players while their powers grow and diminish evoke the Prisoner's Dilemma and other thought experiments in philosophy and mathematics.  But by the end the book is more an exploration of ideas set out by cosmologists and theoreticians (like [**Max Tegmark** in _The Mathematical Universe_](http://timeteam.github.io/physics%20and%20mathematics/philosophy/2014/12/12/The-Beginning-of-Infinity.html)): Is the universe a mathematical object?  What would the other dimensions hypothesised by physicists look like if we could encounter them?  In **Cixin Liu**'s vision, quantities such as the cosmological constant and speed of light are opportunities, not constraints.
