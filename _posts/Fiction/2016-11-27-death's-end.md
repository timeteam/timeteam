A worthy conclusion to the _Three-Body Problem_ books and ideas.

**Cixin Liu** is a SF novelist not short of ambition.  The scope confronted in this book are likely to leave the reader, for a while, uninterested in little issues in the here and now.  As might be expected by a novel which ends at the end of the universe, and scouts out so many original ideas along the journey.  The first parts of this novel feel like a realisation of game theory with scenarious played out between human and tri-solaris civilisation, and also between factions of humans.  The strategies employed by various players while their powers grow and diminish evoke the Prisoner's Dilemma and other thought experiments in philosophy and mathematics.  But by the end the book is more an exploration of ideas set out by cosmologists and theoreticians like [**Max Tegmark**'s _Our Mathematical Universe_](http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/mathematical.html) and [**David Deutsch** in _The Beginning of Infinity_](http://timeteam.github.io/physics%20and%20mathematics/philosophy/2014/12/12/The-Beginning-of-Infinity.html)): Is the universe a mathematical object?  What would the other dimensions hypothesised by physicists look like if we could encounter them?  In **Cixin Liu**'s vision, quantities such as the cosmological constant and speed of light are opportunities, not constraints.

It says something about this book that the way that contemporary theories in physics and cosmology are weaved into the story in an entirely (to me) believable way, yet human interactions and political scenarious in near- and far-future societies seem naive and unbelievable. The ways that various narrative tools (like memoir excerpts) are used to explain what is going on also seems clumsy; certainly not the sort of thing the late and much lamented **Iain M. Banks** would ever be caught doing.  It is a pity that many potential readers of hard SF can't get past these trivial blemishes to the really important stuff.  Great ideas about what might be possible if one was out and about in the universe.
