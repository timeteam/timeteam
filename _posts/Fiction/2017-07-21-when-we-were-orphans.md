<b>Kazuo Ishiguro</b> 2000. _When we were orphans_. London: Faber and Faber.  313 pp.

What a very good novel.  **Kazuo Ishiguro** allows the novel to unfold in way that is at once gentle, measured but also deeply considered.  He very obviously has his destination in clear sight but peels back the layers of the characters
