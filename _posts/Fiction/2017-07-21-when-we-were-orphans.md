What a very good novel.  

Between the wars, English companies are profiting from the opium trade between India and China; an ex-patriot Englishman works for one such company, his wife campaigns against the trade; both parents disappear in Shanghai; their young son returns to foster care in London.  He returns to Shanghai as an adult just before the outbreak of the Second World War in an attempt to solve the case.  By now he has become the successful detective he always aspired to be, and to boot has his own foster daughter in his care in London and is chasing at snail's pace his love, yet another orphan, also now in Shanghai in a marriage of convenience.  The Koumintang, communist Chinese and Japanese are in a war that is a harbinger and microcosm of the grotesque atrocities of the the Second World War.   

**Kazuo Ishiguro** allows the novel to unfold in way that is at once gentle, measured but also deeply considered.  He very obviously has his destination in clear sight but peels back the layers of the characters
