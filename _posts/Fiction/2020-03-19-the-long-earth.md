A "parallel universes" novel with the multiverse theory made palatable with Terry Pratchett's light touch with technical detail, which takes second place to character, wry story elements and not to allow a few contradictions and failures of logic to get in the way of a yarn.  Really a vehicle for his morality and hopes for how the world should be.  Not sure how the collaboration with Stephen Baxter worked but it looks a lot like they came up with the ideas and Terry Pratchett did the writing.  Not sure I need to read the remaining books in this theme though.
