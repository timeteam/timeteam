<b>Andrew Caldecott</b> 2015. _Rotherweird_. London: Jo Fletcher Books.

***
**Andrew Caldecott** is a QC who defended the Guardian in the Leveson Inquiry into the British phone hacking scandal, among many privacy- and media-related cases.  He is also a successful playwright.  It is hardly surprising then that the book received a [benevolent review](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/18/rotherweird-by-andrew-caldecott-review) in the Guardian.   

<img align="right" src="https://www.quercusbooks.co.uk/assets/Quercus/img/book/619/isbn9781784297619.jpg" alt="">  The spiffing cover accurately raises expectations of the content: a mix of **J.K. Rowling**, **Hieronymus Bosch** and perhaps a touch of **Jonathan Swift**.
