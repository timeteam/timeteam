Embarks with a good idea to work with: a benevolent AI to guide humanity into the future as the sun unexpectedly and suddenly comes to the end of its life.  But the delivery relies on pop psychology, pop molecular biology, pop romance, page-turner action sequences, defies our almost total ignorance of the basis of human memory and consciousness and flies in the face of the laws of physics and everything we know about cell biology.  And furthermore, the title exposes the outcome.
