A meaty little vignette which later became part of **Greg Egan**'s novel _Diaspora_.

Humans are now rendered in software, having been scanned generations ago, are now cloning and reprogramming themselves in large numbers and sending the clones out to explore the galaxy, seeking evidence of life to confirm their hyptheses of what the meaning of the universe might be.   One such voyaging ship has found the first example, large "carpets" submerged and slowly moving through an ocean.  The carpets are hardly candidates for sentient life, each one being  comprised of a single long  carbohydrate molecule. But it turns out they are behaving as a Turing Machine made up of Wang tiles (renamed Wang's Carpets by the human clones who discovered them).

(Wang tiles)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_tile] are a mathematical system proposed by **Hao Wang** in the form of a conjecture that [simplified] square tiles with differently coloured sides can fill an plane, and if so in a periodic pattern.

Searching for more information on Wang Tiles and led to a couple of discoveries:
An interesting site listing and discussing [Mathematical Fiction](http://kasmana.people.cofc.edu/MATHFICT/) by mathematician **Alex Kasman**, which in turn led to:

Physicist, author and musician **Catherine Asaro** who has published an essay on _Wang's Carpets_ titled _Strange Loops of Wonder_ and originally published, of all places, in _Tangent_, a fashion magazine.  (Subsequently reprinted in _Projections: Science Fiction in Literature & Film_ edited by **Lou Anders**.  **Catherine Asaro** seems to be one impressive dude and some of her books are now added to my in-tray; also her [author page](http://www.catherineasaro.net/works/35) and [blog](https://catherineasaro.wordpress.com/) contain many things to read.
