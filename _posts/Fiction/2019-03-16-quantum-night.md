Takes two thought experiments from philosophy-consciousness research and turns them into an improbable near future (tomorrow) novel.  David Chalmers' "everyone could be zombies and we would never know" and Roger Penrose /Stuart Hameroff's "consciousness requires quantum processes and these take place in microtubules".  

Given that almost nobody outside philosophy departments would give either of these ideas any credibility, let alone both, the novel itself can hardly fare any better.  Except as another thought experiment.  The author turns this into a bit of a page-turner but the only credible part is the behaviour of the US President, Donald Trump wearing a paper thin disguise, no doubt to avoid legal action.

However the protagonist character, a psychology professor with a psychopath past, seems to have too many autobiographical elements, for example Dad jokes.  The execution is way too parochial with way too many gratuitous references to Canadian customs, local trivia and fast food products.  Makes it hard to take seriously, even as SF, and very distracting for readers from elsewhere.
