Billed as a time travel novel but really aims elsewhere: a stab at the simulation hypothesis.  Despite being an obvious a covid lockdown project and oblivious, or simply avoiding, some basic physics (like the impact of different gravities on travellers hopping between the earth and the moon) I loved it, a simple, elegantly told yarn across several centuries.  Well conceived, both the idea, the realisation, and the characters.
