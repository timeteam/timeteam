This weird Argentinian folly seems to have many friends, but I had to give up on it.  There are small touches of Italo Calvino but these promising echoes are drowned out by way to much strangeness and misogynistic dialogue.  The author is a woman, born in another age (1928) so either this strange view of the world was then endemic or, more likely, I just don't understand Angélica Gorodischer.
