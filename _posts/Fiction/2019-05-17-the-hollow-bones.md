<img align="right" width="256" src="https://cdn2.penguin.com.au/covers/400/9780143788911.jpg" alt="">  Thinly drawn characters and plot.  The Nazi-sponsored scientist-collector, his wife who has to attend Nazi bride school & give up her cultural activities for the regime. An expedition into unknown Tibet for ostensibly for science but really to seek validation for a loopy Aryan theory. 

An attempt at a cautionary "lesson" for collectors, for ambition in careers and so on, but one I found unconvincing and difficult to engage with.

The real [Ernst Sch√§fer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Sch%C3%A4fer) wasn't so different it seems, ornithologist,  claimed to be in the SS under duress, and became part of the Nazi diaspora to South America post-war (after being exonerated for war crimes).
