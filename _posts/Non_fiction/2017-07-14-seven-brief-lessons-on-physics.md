The ideas in this book (which was originally published as separate articles in the Sunday supplement of an Italian newspaper) are also covered in the later book by the same author, [Reality is not what it seems](http://timeteam.github.io/mathematics%20and%20physics/2017/07/03/reality-is-not-what-it-seems.html).  Yet this account is shorter and even easier to grasp, I think because the chapters seem somehow to lean on each other more easily, so that the book seems more unified.  Thus, reading both, even consecutively, is still immensely rewarding.  

Being about half the length of the (already brief) later book, something is of course missing.  Notably the introductory section on the development of scientific thought from the pre-Socratics to **Einstein**; it is essential to also read _Reality is not what it seems_ in order to enjoy that masterful history.  Otherwise the structure is familiar: lesson one on  general relativity; two on quantum mechanics; three on the structure of the cosmos; four on the elemental particles; five on quantum gravity; six on time as an emergent property of thermodynamics and probability; and the last on what it means for humans.

There were a few things that I grasped more thoroughly or was even more amazed by in this book: 

The extraordinary leap by **Werner Heisenberg** to imagine, and then demonstrate mathematically, that electrons do not exist in between the quantum interactions they have in the orbit of an atom.  They are brought into being by collision.

> Scientific thought is fed by the capacity to 'see' things differently than they have previously been seen.
