The ideas in this book (which was originally published as separate articles in the Sunday supplement of an Italian newspaper) are also covered in the later book by the same author, [Reality is not what it seems](http://timeteam.github.io/mathematics%20and%20physics/2017/07/03/reality-is-not-what-it-seems.html).  Yet this account is shorter and even easier to grasp, I think because the chapters seem somehow to lean on each other more easily, so that the book seems more unified.  Thus, reading both, even consecutively, is still immensely rewarding.  

Being about half the length of the (already brief) later book, something is of course missing.  Notably the introductory section on the development of scientific thought from the pre-Socratics to **Einstein** is  missing here; it is essential to also read _Reality is not what it seems_ in order to enjoy that masterful history.
