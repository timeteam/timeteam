This book covers much of the same ground as the later book [Reality is not what it seems](http://timeteam.github.io/mathematics%20and%20physics/2017/07/03/reality-is-not-what-it-seems.html) by the same author.  Yet reading both, even consecutively, is still immensely rewarding.  

The 7 chapters here were originally published in the Sunday supplement of an Italian newspaper.  Yet thi

The pre-Socratics especially **Anaximander** and **Democritus** (space is finite but boundless, atoms are indivisible); **Plato** and **Pythagoras** (mathematics is the key to understanding the universe); **Copernicus** and **Galileo** (observe, experiment, interpret); **Newton** (the laws that prevail on Earth are those that dictate and predict the behaviour of the stars and planets); **Faraday** and **Maxwell** (matter as particles and fields).

Part 2 is about that quantum revolution wrought by **Albert Einstein** and those who developed his theories.  **Einstein**'s special relativity (1905) takes **Newton**'s Cartesian space in which masses interact over time and replaces it with spacetime. General relativity (1915) goes further: **Faraday** and **Maxwell**'s theory of matter represented as particles and electromagnetic fields is joined so that there is now a single field, spacetime, and particles. Subsequent major developments are led by key contributors including the mathematicians **Gauss** and **Reiman**, **Bohr**, **Planck**, **Heisenberg** and of course **Paul Dirac** and **Richard Feyneman**. **Carlo Rovelli** summarises the main features of the resulting theory of quantum mechanics as  being _granularity_ (information in a system is finite and determined by Planck's constant), _indeterminacy_ (the past does not determine the future, summed statistical probabilities notwithstanding) and _relationality_ (all events interact).  

Part 3 and part 4 comprise the last third of the book and describe the essentials of loop quantum gravity, and the implications of that theory. Besides **Carlo Rovelli**, **Lee Smolin** and **Martin Bojowald** have also been key contibutors.  I am not game to summarise **Rovelli**'s already concise account which somehow omits the mathematics while still showing how vital it is.   In loop quantum gravity spacetime is granular, comprised of quantised (indivisible) units.  The quantum fields of loop quantum gravity do not occur within space, they comprise space.  I think. Better re-read this.  Regularly.  There are some possible consequences: 

 * Infinity disappears. Space is quantised and finite but boundless - **Democritus** got there 2600 years earlier.
 * Thermodynamics can be reformulated in terms of information theory.  
 * Time disappears.  Time is unnecessary for the physics of loop quantum gravity.  Time is just the emergent property of entropy.  "The march of time" is just us and our universe cooling down.  Therefore time is information we don't have - the loss of information is another way of saying the increase of entropy.
 
Quantum gravity theory, like string theory, is just starting to be tested.  Observations that tend to support quantum gravity include the failure (so far) of the Large Hadron Collider to observe supersymmetric particles (predicted by string theory).   Also, fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation may prove to better support the predictions of quantised spacetime but this mathematics is not yet developed. Unsurprisingly.

(I can't help but wonder if the quantised spacetime of quantum gravity is a more plausible operating system than the 11 dimensions of string theory: which would we expect to observe if we were living in a [simulation](http://www.simulation-argument.com/)?)

The annotated bibliography is also notable: only 4 pages in which books by or about **Aristotle**, **Democritus**, **Dirac**, **Einstein**, **Feyneman**, **Heisenberg**, **Newton** and **Plato** appear in ones and twos alongside 7 references by **Carlo Rovelli** himself.  Got to like that!

**Carlo Rovelli** also has a shorter account of quantum gravity in [Physics World November 2003](http://cgpg.gravity.psu.edu/people/Ashtekar/articles/rovelli03.pdf) and the [references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity#References) at the end of the Wikipedia page are extensive.

Among the compelling reasons to return regularly to this book are the memorable aphorisms which **Carlo Rovelli** arrives at in telling fashion.  Such as
