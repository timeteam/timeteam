John Mauceri was a student fo Leonard Bernstein, whose memorable assessment fo the power of classical music is that it leaves the listener thinking that there is something right in the world.  Full of stories from a career in conducting, yet still Lots to learn and enjoy in this.  The nicest short and natural description of sonata form.  And I didn't know that despite all thnat has been written about the gulf between Brahms and Wagner, when Wagner died Brahms paid homage by using a melody sung by Sieglinde in The Ring in the third movement of his third symphony.
