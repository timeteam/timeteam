This little book should be a lot more interesting that it turned out to be.  The author divulges the reason for this early on: he likens the subject of the story, **Leonardo of Pisa** , more often known as **Fibonacci**, to **Steve Jobs** or **Bill Gates**.  All three had transformative roles, not for original ideas, but for making the ideas of other people into technology that everyone can use easily.  The story is about how **Leonardo** learned Arabic (actually Hindu- or Indian-Arabic) numerals and how to do arithmetic with them while travelling with his father in North Africa.  **Leonardo** transformed calculations and trade in Europe by writing an instruction book, _Liber abacci_, so that others could do it.  Arguably he wrote the first software manual that now exists only as  3 copies of the 2nd edition.  It is about as interesting as a software manual: a 600+ page book mostly comprising worked examples (no screen-shots but insteaed images of hand shapes as number prompts).

**Keith Devlin** is a retired mathematician with many other books published, but he struggles a bit with the content here, for the above reason but also because little is known of the life of **Leonardo** so the book has many statements qualified with "probably", "could have", "likely" and so on.

There is always something to learn and be interested in, however.  

The bibliography is reasonably extensive.
