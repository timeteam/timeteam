This is Adam Nicolson's account of his 6 month voyage along the Atlantic coasts of the British Isles in a refitted 40 foot beamy wooden yacht the _Auk_.  It is at once a sublimely written narrative, and an admission of the great stress this voyage caused to his (hired) skipper, George Fairhurst, and to his wife Sarah Raven.  Not the least because of the accompanying BBC 4 film crew, who cause Nicolson to make danagerous decions that very nearly cause drownings. It is only these idiotic decisions, and a not quite successful attempt at self-effacement, that separate Adam Nicolson's narrative from Arthur Ransome's account of sailing _Racundra_.
