A compelling narrative, by an writer of great humility and humanity, and with a natural writer's grasp of language.  Nowadays a 20 year old student at Harvard with eyesight problems would visitan opthalmologist.  In 1835 Richard Henry Dana signed up for a 2 year sailing voyage round Cape Horn.  Time and again his understated narrative displays his wilingness for adventure and unwillingness to shirk a duty, lest someone else should have to do it.  And Dana's eyesight never fails to recognise the plight of those around him who are wronged.

Time travel to pre-gold rush California where hides are wealth and currency, where a few frontier settlements of a handful of dwellings traded hides to visiting merchant ships. In in a postscript to the 1869 edition Dana revisits these frontier trading sites in California, where for example, San Francisco has been transformed in 24 years from a virtual 2 house settlement to a city of 10,000 people.
