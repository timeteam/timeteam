A short book and a pleasure to read, very proficient summaries in turn of not just the life and perils of the Eastern Curlew but also migratory shorebird biology and conservation, systematics, and some related art and performance projects including those of Jackie Kerin and the [Flyway Print Exchange](http://www.kategorringesmith.com.au/the-flyway-print-exchange.html) and especially Kyoko Imazu's [Eastern Curlew print](https://www.weekendnotes.com/im/002/01/kyokoimazutravelled.gif).
