A short book and a pleasure to read, not just brilliantly evoking the life and perils of the Eastern Curlew and of wader watchers.  The author also relates visits to stopovers in China and Korea, and the breeding destination in Russia, and also writes very proficient summaries in turn of migratory shorebird biology and conservation, bird systematics and taxonomic progress, and some related art and performance projects including those of Jackie Kerin and the [Flyway Print Exchange](http://www.kategorringesmith.com.au/the-flyway-print-exchange.html).  Especially Kyoko Imazu's Eastern Curlew print; the "travelled" version is especially compelling:

I didn't realise that some waders gain and lose 60% of their body weight before and after migration.
