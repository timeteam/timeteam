Useful summary of feedback loops in ecology and in molecular ecology/physiology.  I can't quite shake the feeling that the keystone species phenomenon is more complex than is protrayed here, but it does make for a compelling conversation and public messaging.  Only the ecological content appears in the documentary of the same name which includes a few additional ecological case-histories.<img align="right" src="http://timeteam.github.io/images/Gapminder_income_life_2022.png" alt="">
