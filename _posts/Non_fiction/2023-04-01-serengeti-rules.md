Useful summary of feedback loops in ecology and in molecular ecology/physiology.  I can't quite shake the feeling that the keystone species phenomenon is more complex than is protrayed here, as is suggested for example by Isabella Tree in _Lilding_ (The Kepp Estate project in Sussex).  But it does make for a compelling conversation and public messaging.  Only the ecological content appears in the documentary of the same name which includes a few additional ecological case-histories.
