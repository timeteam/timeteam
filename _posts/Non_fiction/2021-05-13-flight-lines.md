Ostensibly about the Grey Plover (which I haven't knowingly seen yet) but really this is just the hook, there is a lot about other migratory shorebirds especially godwits, Spoon-billed Sandpiper especially.  This is how to write a natural history narrative: extensively researched but with a light touch, not a lecture. A great summary of recent discoveries about migration in shorebirds in general and about the Of course a lot also about the loss of habitat in the Yellow Sea and   elsewhere along the flyway and the natural history and prehistory of Wrangel Island.  By far the best natural history book of recent years.
