The "other matters" referred to in the subtitle are mostly items of nonsense verse for which Brendel has a liking; at 89 that can be excused. There is also an essay on Dada which I found not very interesting (no doubt Dada would have approved).

Alfred Brendel's essays on music here are less substantial than his previous writings.  Again understandable.  A short but informative piece on Haydn's _Seven Last Words_; an essay on compositions in major and minor keys; an essay which is both about Schubert's _Winterreise_ abd a book review of Ian Bostridge's _Schubert's Winter Journey: anatomy of an obsession_ (also published by Faber & Faber); and very interesting performance notes on Schumann's Piano Concerto (Brendel likes Dinu Lipatti's recording but not that of Alfred Cortot).
