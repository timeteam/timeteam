An easily consumed account of how undirected curiosity-driven research into the bacterial genome and immune systems led to the discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 and the development of that into a cheap, simple (if you are a biochemist) and widely available gene editing system.  

Miscellaneous comments, positives: 

* Short easy to read and easy to understand chapters
* "Prokaryotes" is a non-group, rather like "invertebrates", I didn't realise that.


Miscellaneous comments, negatives:

 - Too many USA colloquialisms, including a few that nobody who has mostly lived in other countries will understand.
 - Too much of Carl Woese.  I found no evidence that he was as important as Quammen seems to think.  Woese undoubtedly had flashes of brilliance
