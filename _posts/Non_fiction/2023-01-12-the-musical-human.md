Not sure what this is about, nor if even the author knows what he is trying to say.  

Only managed to read the first three chapters, and the last, and a few random paragraphs in between.  Most sentences and paragraphs are equally incomprehensible, just a blizzard of factlets, seemingly selected at random.  And plenty of arbitrary and poorly supported opinions including more than a few contradictions, such as "I yield to no one in my worship at Mozart's altar" then immediately proceeds to yield, heaps.
