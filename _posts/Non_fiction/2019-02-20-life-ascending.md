Nick Lane's tour of his choice of the 10 iconic and transformative evolutionary advances in the history of life on earth.  The first 8 chapters are: the origin of life; DNA; photosynthesis; the complex cell; sex; movement; sight; hot blood. Most of this territory is covered more powerfully and with more up to date material in his more recent _The Vital Question_ (2015).

But worth reading just for Chapter 9: Consciousness.  He isn't afraid to pass judgement, positive and negative, on the big names in the field.

And Nick Lane agrees that Julian Jaynes is obviously daft to assert that the Homer of the _Iliad_ was not consciously aware while just a hundred or few years later the Homer of the _Odyssey_ was.

Nick Lane would, I think, find a lot in common with Carlo Rovelli on consciousness.  Both empirical, which is surely an increasingly important approach where problems are increasingly challenging.

  and
  
   > You are the music while the music lasts [T.S. Eliot]

(Rovelli would perhaps only add that his theory that the arrow of time that is entropy gives us more.)  

They both agree that consciousness is all in the timing - tens to hundred millisecond scale over which incoming signals are integrated into an awareness, a model of nearby reality.  Images which fly past faster than that are seen but not consciously registered.  This matches roughly the ~40 Herz frequency with which groups of neurons fire, a phenomenon apparently correlated with conscious experiences in some experimental settings (cf Christof Koch & Francis Crick; also Gerald Edelman coming from a different (immunological) perspective.

The final chapter, 10, Death. ...
