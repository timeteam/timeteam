Nick Lane's tour of his choice of the 10 iconic and transformative evolutionary advances in the history of life on earth.  The first 8 chapters are: the origin of life; DNA; photosynthesis; the complex cell; sex; movement; sight; hot blood. Most of this territory is covered more powerfully and with more up to date material in his more recent _The Vital Question_ (2015).

But worth reading just for Chapter 9: consciousness.  He isn't afraid to pass judgement, positive and negative, on the big names in the field.  Julian Jaynes is obviously daft to assert that the Homer of the _Iliad_ was not consciously aware while the Homer of the _Odyssey_ was.

Nick Lane would, I think, find a lot in common with Carlo Rovelli on consciousness.  Both empirical, which is surely an increasingly important approach where problems are increasingly challenging. 



  > The first thing we must do is dispose of the idea that consciousness is anything like it seems.  it's not.
