Haruki Murakami knows a lot about music and is not afraid to let it show in these transcripts of conversations with Seiji Ozawa. But how to pull this off without sounding like a know-all nerd?  It is churlish to find fault with such knowledgeable folk but the gossip and pocket-pissing get a bit much after a while, even though there is a lot to learn.  For example how Brahms instructs his wind players to alternate breathing to ensure continuous notes.  And to try out the Mitsuko Uchida - Kurt Sanderling - Concertgebouw Orchestra recording of Beethoven's 3rd Piano Concerto.
