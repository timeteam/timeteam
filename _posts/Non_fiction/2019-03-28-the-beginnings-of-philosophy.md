A short but densely argued book by an author totally at ease with her subject.  And therefore a pleasure to read, even if the detailed and extensively referenced academic issues discussed go way further than I need.  However the author would surely argue that when so much of the material is available only as second- or third-hand accounts and has been the subject of conflicting assessments, there is no escaping a detailed and systematic discussion.  And anyway, I am surely not among the intended readership.

Some of the questions raised are recurring chicken and egg topics, like "did philosophy build polis or the other way around?", "did literacy build thinking or did thinking come first?" and other circular arguments endlessly debated by philosophers.  What I did not find in this discussion was any suggestion of how ecology and wealth of society must have been crucial (a Jaren Diamond approach).  But surely a stable and wealthy society would (and still is) crucial for a significant number of thinkers to have the luxury of thinking about more than how to survive and obtain food.   

The chronological chart on pp xix - xx was vital so I have this heavily truncated and lightly annotated  version:



| year BCE  | who / where      |     what                                              |
| ----------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 776       | First Olympic games |  |
| 750-725?  | Homer               |   is the background rather than the focus to Sassi's book|
| 700       | Hesiod              |   earliest of the notable "pre-socratics" - some say influenced by the Bablylonians  |
| 620-610   | Athens and Miletus  |   tyrany |
| 600       | Thales              |    "father of philosophy" according to some [but omitted from the index!]  |
| 555       | Anaximander         |   First to imagine a world without gods    |
|           | Samos     |    construction of temple of the Hera |
| 550       | Samos     |    construction of the tunnel of Samos begins |
| 545       | Anaximenes              |    student of Anaximander |
| 525       | Pythagoras              |    probably known to Anaximander (according to Carlo Rovelli) |
| 497       | birth of Sophocles              |     |
| 494       | Miletus              |   tyrant Aristagoras destroys the city and population  |
| 490-480       | Persian Wars              |    |
|               | Parmenides              |     |
|               | Zeno              |    |
| 440-430       | Herodotus              |    writes history systematically |
|        | Sophocles              |   probably writing many plays in this period  |
| 431-404       | Peloponnesian War              |     |
| 427       | birth of Plato              |     |
| 415-413       | Democritus              |     |
|               | Thucydides              |     |
|               | Aristophanes              |     |
| 403       | democracy restored in Athens              |     |
| 399       | death of Socrates              |    |

But Anaximander emerges as the figure who had the earliest impact and about who we have best knowledge, although almost nothing first-hand. Nevertheless, his originality and independence stands out not just because the work of others has gone missing.  So has that of Anaximander. This treatment has all the elements of the summary by [Carlo Rovelli](http://timeteam.github.io/mathematics%20and%20physics/history%20and%20pre-history/2017/08/26/anaximander.html).  First to conceive of a world without gods.  Thought it natural to question earlier thinkers.  Probably the first to choose to write prose rather than verse.

The index is hopelessly inadequate: omits, eg, Miletus, Thales, Zeno and no doubt dozens of other people and places.

On the other hand, the bibliography is extensive and has many references I wish I had time to read.
