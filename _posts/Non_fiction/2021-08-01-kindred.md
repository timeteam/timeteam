I didn't know that there were (at least) two cultures within the Neanderthals, east and west, recognisable by their stone tools.

Exhaustively researched by someone who of course has a deep knowledge of research on Neanderthals but it is a huge negative that the references are not part of the book but are in a document on the author's web site where they have no link to the text and no annotation, thus it isn't possible to source any supporting reference.  The book itself doesn't even contain a further reading section.  Which is very limiting because much of the book is given over to statements prefaced by "might have ..." "could have ... "it is easy to imagine that ...".  Therefore, even though Sykes has succeeded in evoking Neanderthals in a convincing way, it is easy to imagine that her speculations are often wrong.  An objective and concise summary of what is _known_ about Neanderthals is much more easily absorbed at [the Neanderthal Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal).
