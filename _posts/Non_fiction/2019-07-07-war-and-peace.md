<b>Leo Tolstoy</b> - _War and Peace_ 2010 (this edition), 1869 (first complete publication). Translated by Louse & Aylmer Maude, revised and edited with introduction by Amy Mandelker. Oxford: Oxford World Classics. 1350 pp.

Monumental, unclassifiable.  Neither a novel, nor a history, nor any one thing.  I recall reading somewhere that Tolstoy simply described it as "what I could write" or some such.  I think it is his cosmology, his model and realisation of the human universe, and maybe not just the human one.
