<b>Tracy Kidder</b> 1981. _The Soul of a New Machine_. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 293 pp.

I think I first read this in the early 1980s, fairly soon after it was published.  Almost as enjoyable to re-read nearly 40 years later.  It was a Pullitzer Prize winner and an instant cult classic in both computer geeks as well as business management.



[Science Friday](https://www.sciencefriday.com/) (no longer just a book club) has a  [YouTube interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wq3ucqnaSk) with three of the engineers from the project.  It doesn't say much that isn't in the book but it is very nice to see them speak about the project and their affection for project leader and engineer **Tom West**, who died in 2011.
