Gregory Chaitin has substantial publications on GÃ¶del and Turing but I was disappointed by the lack of substance in this attempt to provide a mathematical basis to Darwinian evolution.  After wading through a kind of reading diary on evolution and mathematics Chaitin produced his "toy model" in his own words of evolution: a mathematical organism that evolves by increasing a (single ) "fitness" variable through an "algorithmic mutation".  No real world evolutionary phenomenon is included (decrease in fitness; fitness as a result of interaction with other organisms or the environment, only 1 dimension to fitness just for starters.  Despite high hopes on encountering this title, Gregory Chaitin hasn't engaged with evolution at all, nor with me.
