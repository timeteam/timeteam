I think the principal ideas and reasoning are thus:

Entropy, the equation for which was discovered by Clausius and the true significance of which was realised by Boltzman, never decreases _over time_.  It is the only fundamental equation in physics which requires a term for time.  

Thus, entropy and thermodynamics are intimately related to time.  So, argues Carlo Rovelli, perhaps entropy creates time.  Which would mean that low entropy is required -- why should there be low entropy?  Either it is an extraordinarily improbably special condition that has to be explained, or else it is only our part of the universe where entropy was low and thus perhaps not so improbable.  As a consequence, time "flows" for us due to thermodynamics but is not universal in other regions where entropy was never low.

The traces of thermodynamic events in the past seem to be causes and memories to us, but according to this view these things are (p. 147):

> nothing but names we give to the consequences of a statistical fact: the improbability of a past state of the universe

Simple really.
