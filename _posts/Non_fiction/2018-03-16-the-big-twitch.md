Ostensibly a diary of Sean Dooley's twitching year, in which he devoted 2005 and more than $40,000 to criss-crossing Australia to observe ("twitch") 703 species of birds in Australia (I think the current record is 745, in 2012 by John Weigel). In reality it is at least as much a memoir of mild psychiatric interest.  Anyway, this kind of behavious, like this book, it is seriously weird. On the other hand, compared with bombing the crapper out of countries on the other side of the world where we have no business, or digging new mines for coal that we have no need of, I guess it is a comparatively harmless kind of weirdness.  

Sean Dooley, now editor of _Birdlife_ magazine, certainly knows heaps about birds, but that only slips out now and then in between making sly comments about himself and other twitchers.  Interspersed with comments that are sometimes mildly witty, othertimes not.  Very many folk with a natural history bent would give a lot to have a year to devoteto birdwatching, but not to dashing off from so many wonderful places after only a day or so just because no further new "ticks" were possible.  Looking back nearly 15 years, I daresay Sean Dooley would rather not have exposed quite so much of his weirdness, for example the sprinkling of comments about his girlfriends who are scattered through the text like cardboard cutouts.  Probably he is a much nicer guy in the flesh but some of these these youthful attempted witticisms don't come out well.

I never intended to finish reading this, but I must be weird too and I did finish it despite myself.  Sort of like watching a late night rerun of a very ordinary Clint Eastwood movie.
