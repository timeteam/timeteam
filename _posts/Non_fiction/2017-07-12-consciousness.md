This book should be much more interesting than it is, coming from a long-time collaborator of the late great **Francis Crick**.  Instead, it is poorly structured and not very original (I found nothing that isn't covered more cogently by **David Eagleman**, **Ray Kurzweil** and others).  All the frequently-asked questions are dealt with (free will, the "hard" problem, are animals conscious?, what structures might be neural correlates of consciousness, etc.) but I found it was hard to grasp what, if anything, the author wants to say about progress in the field.  If this book is a guide, not much.  But that doesn't seem to be the goal; this is rather a memoir, punctuated by increasingly gratuitous and personal anecdotes about youth, children, pets, personal breakdowns, revelations of mortality, marriage collapse and esoteric music interests (some of which I even share).  It reads more like a therapy session, in parts.  With some serious editing the book could have become a rather interesting _Scientific American_ article, but I guess that sort of editing may have precipitated another breakdown.

I'm sure if I were to sit down with **Christof Koch** we could have an enjoyable evening chat together (as long as he hasn't read this).  But he should stick to more prosaic writing.  He has previously written a more traditional book on research in consciousness, _The Quest for Consciousness_ (2004; Roberts & Company), but I haven't been able to get hands on that yet and  am now less inclined to try.  Better, probably, to read the original literature they have published together, such as:
   > Crick, F., and Koch, C. (2003). A framework for consciousness. _Nature Neuroscience_ 6, 119â€“126. doi:10.1038/nn0203-119
   
and **Francis Crick**'s own 1995 book _The Astonishing Hypothesis_ which I read long ago and now need to revisit.
