This book is about a scribe a book hunter - [Poggio Bracciolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poggio_Bracciolini) (1380-1459) and an almost lost manuscript written ~1500 years earlier, by Roman poet [Lucretius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius) (~99-55 BCE). 
Such promising subject matter thus for a long time I had been looking forward to the right moment to read this, so my expectations were probably too high.  This might explain wny I found the early "setting the scene" chapters just a touch slow; given the revolutionary importance of Lucretius they do come across just a touch as filler material.  Hardly a fair judgement, they are interesting and of course crucial to the book.  However the chapter "The way things are" which is an annotated summary of Lucretius' _On the Nature of Things_ is downright thrilling.  Literally and symbolically central to the book.
