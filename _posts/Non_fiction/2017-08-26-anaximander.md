Ostensibly about the pre-Socratic philosopher **Anaximander** and his place in the history of science, this wonderful book is more about science itself and about how human culture and thinking has changed from a world view which relied on a god or gods to explain natural forces to a more 'naturalist' account where events can be explained by a rational investigation of the properties of the things which make up our world. Clearly this transition is far from complete and is hotly resisted by a variety of conservative forces around the world (each relying on belief in their own mutually exclusive religion for validation).       

A sampling of the chapter titles gives raises expectations (which are not disappointed): _Invisible entities and natural laws_, _Rebellion becomes virtue_, _What is science?_, _Can we understand the world without gods?_.  

**Anaximander** himself, as brought to life here, was remarkable.  His writings are all lost in the original and he is only known from secondary sources, yet a reading of these shows that aside from leading a change away from a theistic world view and towards natural law, he was also the first person to suggest that the Earth was an object suspended in space and it doesn't fall because "there is nowhere for it to fall to"; that rain was water evaporated from Earth; that the sun, moon and stars rotate around the Earth; that all animals originated in the sea.  Most important of all, he established a culture of questioning the view of those whose views were handed down.  It is this constant questioning which leads to continual improvement in our ability to explain reality according to natural laws.  This is science, and it has no endpoint and thus never has a "certain" answer.  Alsmost as an aside on this journey **Rovelli** makes a compelling case (contra **Feyerarbend** and **Lakatos**) that this process is an evolutionary improvement building on previous theories, not a revolutionary process where they are discarded and replaced in entirety.

The bibliography contains many books I didn't know about and will seek out; it is much more extensive than in **Rovelli**'s  other two current popular science books.
