Ostensibly about the pre-Socratic philosopher **Anaximander** and his place in the history of science, this wonderful book is more about science itself and about how human culture and thinking has changed from a world view which relied on a god or gods to explain natural forces to a more 'naturalist' account where events can be explained by a rational investigation of the properties of the things which make up our world. Clearly this transition is far from complete and is hotly resisted by conservative forces (each relying on their own  religion for validation!).       

A sampling of the chapter titles gives raises expectations (which are not disappointed): _Invisible entities and natural laws_, _Rebellion becomes virtue_, _What is science?_, _Can we understand the world without gods?_.  
[simulation](http://www.simulation-argument.com/)?)

The bibliography contains many books I didn't know about and will seek out; it is much more extensive than in **Rovelli**'s  other two current popular science books.
