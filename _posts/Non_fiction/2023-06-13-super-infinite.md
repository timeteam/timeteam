Full-immersion biography of the life and times of wild-man poet John Donne by smitten Oxford classicist Katherine Rundell.  Interesting to ponder the differences between contemporaries Donne (born dangerous catholic, diplomat, womaniser then steadfast husband, cleric - Dean of St Paul's as well as poet) and Shakespeare (lifelong professional actor & dramatist).
