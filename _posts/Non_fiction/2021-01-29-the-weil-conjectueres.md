Here Karen Olsson threads her own memoir through the stories of philosopher Simone Weil and her brother, number theory mathematician André Weil.  To learn about these figures efficiently I had to look elsewhere.  The triple-weave seems to me a distraction, I didn't find a reason for the authors own memoir to be included. Simone Weil seems to have been something of a mystic and I didn't find her philosophy (including emptying her thoughts to await incoming intellects of revelations, even god) to be of any moment.  André Weil was more interesting, but his autobiography [reviewed here](http://www.ams.org/notices/199904/rev-varadarajan.pdf) would have been a better choice to read.
