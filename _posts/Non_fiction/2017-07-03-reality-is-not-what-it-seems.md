So far as I can tell there are 2 main attempts to create a single explanatory model of the universe and of reality from **Einstein**'s seemingly incompatible theories, special relativity and general relativity.  One of those research fields is string theory, which is attempting to create a valid model of the universe comprising 11 dimensions.  This book is a guide to the other major research effort: quantum gravity, written by one of the physicists responsible for the earliest developments.

Part 1 comprises the first third of the book, and describes the path to what we learned up to the early 1900s when **Einstein** began the revolution in physics.  The luminaries recognised are the pre-Socratics especially **Anaximander** and **Democritus** (space is finite but boundless, atoms are indivisible); **Plato** and **Pythagoras** (mathematics is the key to understanding the universe); **Copernicus** and **Galileo** (introducing experiment to interpret observations); **Newton** (the laws that prevail on Earth are those that dictate and predict the behaviour of the stars and planets); **Faraday** and **Maxwell** 

Part 2 is about that quantum revolution wrought by **Einstein** and those who developed his theories.  Einstein's special relativity (1905) takes **Newton**'s Cartesian space in which masses interact over time and replaces it with space-time. General relativity (1915) goes further: **Faraday** and **Maxwell**'s theory of matter represented as particles and electromagnetic fields is joined so that there is now a single field, space-time, and particles. 

Part 3 and part 4 comprise the last third of the book and describe the essentials of quantum loop gravity, and the implications of that theory. [alt](URL).
