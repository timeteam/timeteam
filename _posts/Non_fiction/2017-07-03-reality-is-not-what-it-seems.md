<img align="right" src="http://images.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9780735213920" alt="">  What a joy it would be to be able to read this in the original Italian.  However the translation is clear, simple, elegant and concise.  Beautifully written and translated.

So far as I can tell there are 2 main attempts to create a single explanatory model of the universe and of reality from **Einstein**'s seemingly incompatible theories, special relativity () and general relativity ().  One of those research fields is string theory, which is attempting to create a valid model of the universe comprising 11 dimensions.  This book is a guide to the other major research effort: quantum gravity, written by one of the physicists responsible for the earliest developments.

Part 1 comprises the first third of the book, and describes the path to what we learned up to the early 1900s when **Einstein** begain the revolution in physics.

Part 2 is about that quantum revolution wrought by **Einstein** and those who developed his theories.

Part 3 and part 4 comprise the last third of the book and describe the essentials of quantum loop gravity, and the implications of that theory is about quantum theory, Waves vs particles, Schr√∂dinger and quantum entanglement. [alt](URL).
