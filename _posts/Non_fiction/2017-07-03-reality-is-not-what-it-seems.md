So far as I can tell, as of 2017 there are 2 main and competing attempts to create a single explanatory model of the universe and of reality.  Any such model must account for the two currently accepted but seemingly incompatible theories, general relativity and quantum mechanics.  (Incompatible because, for example, quantum mechanics does not account for the curvature of spacetime.) One of those research fields seeking a unified theory of everything is string theory, which is attempting to create a valid model of the universe comprising 11 dimensions.  This book is a guide to the other major research effort: loop quantum gravity, written by one of the physicists responsible for founding this body of work.  Although string theory doesn't get much of a mention the content is otherwise wide-ranging and starts with the earliest recorded beginnings.  The layout is like the prose, simple and logical. 

Part 1 comprises the first third of the book, and describes the path to what we learned up to the early 1900s when relativity and quantum mechanics revolutionised physics.  This fabulous, lucid summary presents 2000 years of scientific progress  as largely the result of just a handful of key thinkers: the pre-Socratics especially **Anaximander** and **Democritus** (space is finite but boundless, atoms are indivisible); **Plato** and **Pythagoras** (mathematics is the key to understanding the universe); **Copernicus** and **Galileo** (observe, experiment, interpret); **Newton** (the laws that prevail on Earth are those that dictate and predict the behaviour of the stars and planets); **Faraday** and **Maxwell** (matter as particles and fields).

Part 2 is about that quantum revolution wrought by **Albert Einstein** and those who developed his theories.  **Einstein**'s special relativity (1905) takes **Newton**'s Cartesian space in which masses interact over time and replaces it with spacetime. General relativity (1915) goes further: **Faraday** and **Maxwell**'s theory of matter represented as particles and electromagnetic fields is joined so that there is now a single field, spacetime, and particles. Subsequent major developments are led by key contributors including the mathematicians **Gauss** and **Reiman**, **Bohr**, **Planck**, **Heisenberg** and of course **Paul Dirac** and **Richard Feyneman**. **Carlo Rovelli** summarises the main features of the resulting theory of quantum mechanics as  being _granularity_ (information in a system is finite and determined by **Plack**'s constant), _indeterminacy_ (the past does not determine the future, summed statistical probabilities notwithstanding) and _relationality_ (all events interact).  

Part 3 and part 4 comprise the last third of the book and describe the essentials of loop quantum gravity, and the implications of that theory. I am not game to summarise **Rovelli**'s already concise account which somehow omits the mathematics while still showing how vital it is.   In loop quantum gravity spacetime is granular, comprised of quantised (indivisible) units.  The quantum fields of loop quantum gravity do not occur within space, they comprise space.  I think. Better re-read this.  Regularly.  Among the consequences: 

 * Infinity disappears. Space is quantised and finite but boundless - **Democritus** got there 2600 years earlier.
 * Time disappears.  Time is unnecessary for the physics of loop quantum gravity.  Time is just the emergent property of entropy.  "The march of time" is just us and our universe cooling down.

Among the compelling reasons to return regularly to this book are the memorable aphorisms which **Carlo Rovelli** arrives at in telling fashion.  Such as
