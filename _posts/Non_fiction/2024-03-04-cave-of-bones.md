Cracking yarn of the discovery and significance of _Homo naledi_ remains in an almost inaccessible cave in South Africa.  _Homo naledi_ lived circa 335,000â€“236,000 years ago and I found the evidence for burial to be convincing.  _Homo naledi_ also decorated cave walls with cross-hatch marks just like _Homo neanderthalensis_.  I guess these are the easiest marks to make so this is what they all do first. Most impressive Lee Berger's account of losing 20 kg in 6 months in order to get into and out of (just) the chamber through a 12 m vertical squeeze.
