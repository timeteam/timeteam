Unusual not to warm to a history book but the very freely-written narrative is so far removed from the original sources that objective information and interpretation are harder than usual to distinguish.  The impression is that the author's striving for a readable text has allowed the reader only passing exposure to the facts (from archaeology and from original texts).  Clearly the author's knowledge of the Persians (=Iranians) is great but there are no citations in the text and more structure is needed.  So I didn't persevere and will try instead some titles from his further reading, including:  


- [Oriental Institute at The University of Chicago](https://oi.uchicago.edu/persia-iran-projects)
- [virtual reconstruction of Perseopolis](http://persepolis3d.com/)
- Allen, Lindsay (2005) _The Persian Empire_ University of Chicago Press.
