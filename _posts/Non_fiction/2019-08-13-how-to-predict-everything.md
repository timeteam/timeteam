Not as interesting as I thought it should have been, and not as interesting as I remember _The Prisoner's Dilemma_ being.  The substantial content is thin: Bayes Theorem in the context of the Copernican Principle: any prediction or analysis that is based on an assumption that the observer occupies a special or priveliged position in a spectrum of possible values is flawed.
