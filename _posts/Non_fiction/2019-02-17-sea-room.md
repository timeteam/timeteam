Adam Nicolson's self-described love letter to his Shiant Islands, part of the Hebrides, 5 miles off the west coast of Scotland.  Memorable for being beautifully written, and thoroughly researched.  Chapters about the geology, archeology, ornithology, history (Clearances), prehistory, culture and people.  Adam Nicolson doesn't do things by halves, having had specialists in most of the above fields visit and make discoveries on the Isles.  Notably archaeology.

A great pleasure.

And the rats are gone from the Shiants: [Shiant Isles website](https://www.shiantisles.net/)
