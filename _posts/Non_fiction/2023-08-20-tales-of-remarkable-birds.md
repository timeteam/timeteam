Natural history portraits of a bunch of birds, drawn from world-wide locations.  Including one on cassowaries, the reading of which coincided with my first sighting of one.  A pleasant book but didn't learn much, most chapters seemed to be chatty expansions of information that could be found in a couple of paragraphs in most bird guides.
