A time capsule from the 1920s.  Plentiful allusions and quotes from bush poets, lots of natural history.  Includes a generous selection of Alex Chisholm's photographs of birds, very average by modern standards but hard won with the equipment of the day.  On the other hand, birds were very evidently more abundant and much more easily found.   Alex Chisholm, a journalist, has to strive gently here to get a conservation message across, so gentle as to be almost apologetic.
