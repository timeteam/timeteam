A more enjoyable read than I first thought.  At once a thorough literature review of recent advances in ornithology and especially on phylogenetic relationships of and within a great many bird groups.  Very readable introductions to many concepts in evolutionary biology (allopatry & sympatry, vicariance & dispersal, the nature of molecular data ... ). Especially interesting was discussions of the possible role of hybridisation (introgression) in speciation, with gene swapping through these back-crosses perhaps being significant more often than currently recognised and accelerating rates of genetic change. (In _Homo_ too?) 

Very extensively referenced with many footnotes plus a short bibliography with lots of titles to seek out.  A reference book to current systematic research across a diversity of bird groups. No loons/divers though.
