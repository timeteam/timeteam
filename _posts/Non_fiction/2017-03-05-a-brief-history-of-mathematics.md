<b>Luke Heaton</b> 2015. _A Brief History of Mathematics. Key concepts and where they come from_. London: Robinson, 321 pp.

***

This is the "foundations of mathematics" book that I've been seeking for a long time.  **Luke Heaton** has an enviable grasp of, arguably, the greatest topic of all and has distilled the essence of it here into 13 chapters.

_Beginnings_ has some slightly unconvincing discussion of cognition, symbols, rituals in prehistoric humans.  The question of whether the concept of counting and recording numbers arose independently mutliple times or was spread with human dispersal is only touched on.  Egypt, Babylon and Mesopotamia too are here but not in depth.  The research into the Babylonian cuneiform tablets doesn't make it and nor does the **Hamurabi** and his stele.

_From Greece to Rome_ is where the grand human project to discover mathematics began and where the book takes off.  That the Greeks had the wit and the curiosity to begin to think about philosophy and mathematics (and that society fostered it) is a thing of wonder.  No doubt the telescoping of 2,000+ years and the scarce archaelogical record mean that antecedents are mostly invisible, although surely they were there. [The Minoans](http://timeteam.github.io/history%20and%20pre-history/physics%20and%20mathematics/2015/12/12/the-riddle-of-the-labyrinth.html), for example.

_Ratio and Proportion_: not only that and sequences but also the nugget that **Leonardo Fibonacci**  was the first to use decimal notation in _Liber Abaci_ (1202). _The Rise of Algebra_ and _Mechanics and the Calculus_ here are given their historical and mathematical contexts with concise clarity, especially **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** published the fundamental theorem of calculus in 1684) but **Isaac Newton** had known of it for nearly 20 years (as with **Charles Darwin** and **Alfred Russel Wallace** 200 years later on natural selection).  **Leibniz** in his proof was explicit about infinitesimals (and had an eye to fame) while **Newton** was more in the geometry line of argumenation (and didn't care who thought what about him).   

_**Leonhard Euler** and the Bridges of Königsburg_ a short account of travelling salesman-type NP complete problems, Euler numbers for geometrical objects and dimensionality.  

_Euclid's Fifth and the Reinvention of Geometry_

There are some interesting omissions, The **Reverend Bayes** is not mentioned (even though there is a chapter on modelling.  Chaos is mentioned briefly but not **Edward Lorenz** or **Benoît Mandelbrot**.  Presumably **Luke Heaton** classes these as not "mathematics" or not "foundational".  Arabian contributions to understanding of mathematics are mentioned now and then (especially regarding algebra) but seem somehow undersold.

The Further Reading section is short but a high proportion of the titles listed were already, or are now, on my in-tray.  They are thoughtfully arranged under six headings that are conceptual and don't relate to the largely chronological arrangement of the chapters.
