<b>Luke Heaton</b> 2015. _A Brief History of Mathematics. Key concepts and where they come from_. London: Robinson, 321 pp.

***

This is the "foundations of mathematics" book that I've been seeking for a long time.  **Luke Heaton** has an enviable grasp of, arguably, the greatest topic of all and has distilled the essence of it here.

The Further Reading section is short but a high proportion of the titles listed were already, or are now, on my in-tray.  They are thoughtfully arranged under six headings that are conceptual and don't relate to the largely chronological arrangement of the chapters.
