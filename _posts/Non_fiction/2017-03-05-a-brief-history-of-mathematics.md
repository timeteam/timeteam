<b>Luke Heaton</b> 2015. _A Brief History of Mathematics. Key concepts and where they come from_. London: Robinson, 321 pp.

***

This is the "foundations of mathematics" book that I've been seeking for a long time.  **Luke Heaton** has an enviable grasp of, arguably, the greatest topic of all and has distilled the essence of it here into 13 chapters.

_Beginnings_ has some slightly unconvincing discussion of cognition, symbols, rituals in prehistoric humans.  The question of whether the concept of counting and recording numbers arose independently mutliple times or was spread with human dispersal is only touched on.  Egypt, Babylon and Mesopotamia too are here but not in depth.  The research into the Babylonian cuneiform tablets doesn't make it and nor does the **Hamurabi** and his stele.

_From Greece to Rome_ is where the grand human project to discover mathematics began and where the book takes off.  That the Greeks had the wit and the curiosity to begin to think about philosophy and mathematics is a thing of wonder.  No doubt the telescoping of 2,000+ years and the scarce archaelogical record mean that antecedents are mostly invisible, although surely they were there. [The Minoans](http://timeteam.github.io/history%20and%20pre-history/physics%20and%20mathematics/2015/12/12/the-riddle-of-the-labyrinth.html), for example.


There are some interesting omissions, The **Reverend Bayes** is not mentioned (even though there is a chapter on modelling.  Chaos is mentioned briefly but not **Edward Lorenz** or **Beno√Æt Mandelbrot**.  Presumably **Luke Heaton** classes these as not "mathematics" or not "foundational".  Arabian contributions to understanding of mathematics are mentioned now and then (especially regarding algebra) but seem somehow undersold.

The Further Reading section is short but a high proportion of the titles listed were already, or are now, on my in-tray.  They are thoughtfully arranged under six headings that are conceptual and don't relate to the largely chronological arrangement of the chapters.
