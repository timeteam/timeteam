<b>Daniel Dennett</b> 2017. _From Bacteria to Bach and Back.  The evolution of minds._ New York: W.W. Norton. 476 pp.

***

In this long, rambling and uninformative book, Daniel Dennett seeks to show that a plausible process exists for the evolution of minds. That the Cartesian duality cannot be accepted. That top down AI does not work. That evolution explains biology including studies of the mind.  And long-winded justifications of a host of other unremarkable propositions that have long been accepted by biologists.  But apparently not by some philosophers, who would otherwise be lacking a topic to produce words on.   

A persistent reader will finally encounter a reasonable pr√©cis of this book in the opening sentence of chapter 14... 



P 200, words/sounds are unlikely to survive unless they can be digitised (i think he means atomised). Goes o  to talk about memes, words as memes, the origin of language, but other than the atomisation statement (which is not  a reasoned argument) nowhere is there an explanation for the origin of words.

2 uninformative chapters describing memes then responding to criticism of whether they exist or are real.

There is an extensive bibliography, mostly philosophy works, but very many referencdes cited in the text are missing.
