A book about the role of carbon in the ecological and biochemical cycles that help understand life, ecology and climate.  Thus, a sort of stochiometric companion to JoÃ«lle Gergis' _Sunburnt Country_ and Eelco Rohling's _The Oceans. A deep history_.

Instructive on the history of key discoveries in the field, particularly chemists Joseph Black (born 1728) who concluded that the gas generated from acid on limestone was the same one that we exhale, and Anoine Lavoisiere and Joseph Priestly who determined the chemistry and properties of COO<sup>2</sup>.
