Ostensibly this book is not directly about the music of **Johann Sebastian Bach**.  Rather it is about modern interpreters who have been responsible for a revived appreciation of **Bach**. Those champions in rough chronological order include: **Felix Mendelssohn** (who gets very few words), **Albert Schweitzer**, **Pablo Casals**, **Leopold Skokowski**, **Glenn Gould**, **Rosalyn Tureck** (who I had not heard of). 

Nor did I know that  **Bach** (1685 – 1750) and **Vivaldi** (1678 – 1741) were such close contemporaries and that **Bach** had such appreciation of **Vivaldi**'s works and transcribed many of them, most famously during an enforced 6 month break from organ playing when the Weimar organ was being rebuilt. 

In more recent times (since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989), other names figure in the final chapters: **Mstislav Rostropovich**, **Isaac Stern** and many others.  

The revolutionary impact of recorded music is a major focus. **Schweitzer**'s recording of the _Toccata and Fugue in D Minor_ on wax cylinders in the church of All Hallows in London in 1935.  **Pablo Casals** making the legendary HMV recordings at Abbey Road Studios in London in 1936.  I didn't known that those studios were built so long ago; they were opened in 1931 by **Sir Edward Elgar** conducting the LSO, nor did I know one of the studios could accommodate an orchestra and an audience of 1,000).  Other early champions of recordings and **Bach** get plenty of discussion: **Leopold Skokowski**, **Glenn Gould**.  (Other forms of music were getting on board at about the same time: on 23 November 1936 while **Pablo Casals** was recording Bach at Abbey Road, **Robert Johnson** was recording _Terraplane Blues_ and other songs in a hotel room in San Antonia, Texas.)
