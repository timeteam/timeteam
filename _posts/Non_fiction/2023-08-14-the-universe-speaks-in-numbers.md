Immensely enjoyable account of the relationship between mathematics and physics in understanding nature.  As would be expected from his biography of Paul Dirac, Graham Farmelo is an advocate for Dirac's view that beauty in mathematical theories is to be sought by those wishing to better explain the universe.   A fabulous account in which Graham Farmelo gives the impression he was in the front row whenever a key discovery was made or seminar presented.
