This huge meal of a book is a rich history of the silk roads.  Not just _the_ Silk Road connecting Persia with Rome, Constantinople and the far East.  But also any trading route or seaway.  But the focus is very much on what is now Iran and 
I took this as a correction to the Western bias of [Sapiens](http://timeteam.github.io/history%20and%20pre-history/2017/09/04/sapiens.html), and a great companion to the history of the "Dark Ages", [The Edge of the World](http://timeteam.github.io/history%20and%20pre-history/2016/01/11/The-edge-of-the-world.html) by **Michael Pye** and also **Richard Fiddler**'s  history of Constantinople, [Ghost Empire](http://timeteam.github.io/history%20and%20pre-history/2017/01/04/ghost-empire.html).  

So rich that the detail sometimes obscures the wider picture and I found it necessary to skip back and forth to secure a new context.  Not even sure if these are the major points to extract.  I think it is a book that requires  familiarity with the material to appreciate fully. In lieu of that, Oxford University has a great [interview with the author](http://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/interviews/turning-history-its-head-peter-frankopan-author-silk-roads-following-call-east). None of it is hard to read, but there is so much ground covered that it demands a significant commitment from the reader.

The early chapters are about the ebb and flow of Christianity and other religions (Buddhism, Zoroastrianism), especially in Constantinople and Persia.  The adoption of Christianity by Rome who pushed it east led to a reaction against such evangelising.  Nevertheless in the centuries before the rise of Islam Christianity was in a strong and seemingly expanding position from Constantinople to Persia and with many outposts beyond (Samarakand and further east, north oof the Aral Sea).  But then (540s AD) bubonic plague devastated populations (10,00 deaths per day in Constantinople) and the survivors were not well disposed towards either rulers or religions.  This seems a central part of the book although it is related in the early chapter, _The Road to Revolution_, where the author shows that  the revelations and teachings of Muhammad, from 610 AD onwards fell on ears receptive to revolution, since cities and populations had been suffering from both plague and from the long-running Roman-Persian wars.  Thus Muhammad was able to unite many pagan and polytheistic Arabian tribes under a new monotheistic religion, Islam.  The early Islamic period saw rapid expansion during the years 628-632 AD, including into Jerusalem which had only recently (614 AD) fallen to Persia (the Romans accused the Jews of assisting the Persians in taking Jerusalem).  It was during this brief period that "Persia", previously a disparate group of tribes, became united Arabs under Muhammad. 
 
Important to recognise, states **Frankopan**, that Islam, Christianity and Judaism were mutually supportive  during the early Islamic period.  Islam and Judaism were especially close, both venerating Abraham (Ibrahim) as prophet and repudiating Jesus the Mesiah.  Early co-operation, respect and acceptance of alternative monotheistic faiths, although stated in the Qu'ran, is long since discarded, tragically. 

The endnotes are extremely extensive and filled with original sources but the lack of a companion bibliography makes it very laborious to track down references, which are only given in full the first time they are used.

What is most glaringly absent is an overview of the content of the chapters, which is hidden behind cryptic chapter titles.  ** Peter Frankopan**'s historical knowledge is often a fresh and informative perspective on modern political and economic issues.  Thus, in order to use this as a reference and since I couldn't find any such summary online I have attempted my own rough outline of the chapters:

1 _The Creation of the Silk Road_  - Mesopotamia and the reach of Greece and pre-Christian Rome into Persia.

2 _The Road of Faiths_  and

3 _The Road to a Christian East_ - Buddhism, Zoroastrianism and especially the spread of Christianity. 

4 _The Road to Revolution_  - The rise of Islam.

5 _The Road to Concord_  - Early interactions between Christianity, Islam and Judaism were relatively peaceful.  Until Rome and Persia came into more territorial conflict.  Islam was better at uniting previously independent and disparate local warlords. 

6 _The Road of Furs_  - Fur and other trade.  Jewish merchants and Vikings ranging far. (Vikings the father or modern Russia:  Rus' = rower).

7 _The Slave Road_  - The Vikings also prominent slave traders.

8 _The Road to Heaven_  - The hypocritical, genocidal and catastrophic Crusades.  Harbingers of equally damaging modern conservative forces.

9 _The Road to Hell_  - **Genghis Khan** and the Mongols.  Not as bad as their reputation would suggest.

10 _The Road of Death and Destruction_  - Black Death kills at least a third of Europe's population. And resets the economy in favour of the West (economic reform by killing 30% of the population - don't tell economists).

11 _The Road of Gold_  - **Columbus** discovers the Americas.

12 _The Road of Silver_  - **Vasco da Gama** rounds the Cape of Good Hope into the Indian Ocean.  

13 _The Road to Northern Europe_  - Britian ...

14 _The Road to Empire_

15 _The Road to Crisis_

16 _The Road to War_

17 _The Road of Black Gold_

18 _The Road to Compromise_

19 _The Wheat Road_

20 _The Road to Genocide_

21 _The Road of Cold Warfare_

22 _The American Silk Road_

23 _The Road of Superpower Rivalry_

24 _The Road to Catastrophe_

25 _The Road to Tragedy_

_Conclusion: The New Silk Road_
