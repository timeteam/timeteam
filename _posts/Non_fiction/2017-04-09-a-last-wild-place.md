I must have first read this at least 20 years ago, and several times since - for the pleasure of the classic nature writing, based on wild animals and plants closely observed over many decades by **Mike Tomkies**.

A modern next gen molecular phylogeny of divers is recently available in the form of [**Quentin Sprengelmeyer**'s Master's thesis](file:///home/robin/Downloads/sprengelmeyer_2014_gavia_phylogeny.pdf).
