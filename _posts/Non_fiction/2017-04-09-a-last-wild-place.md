<b>Mike Tomkies</b> 1984. _A Last Wild Place_. London: Jonathon Cape, 250 pp.

I must have first read this at least 20 years ago, and several times since - for the pleasure of the classic nature writing, based on wild animals and plants closely observed over many decades by **Mike Tomkies**, refugee from Hollywood who spent decades living in wilderness locations and writing about and photographing wildlife, including 19 years living in an abandoned croft at Gaskan (he called it 'Wildernesse') on remote Loch Schiel in western Scotland.   Much of  **Mike Tomkies**' efforts and writing in this and other books revolved around studying Golden Eagles nesting on cliffs above his croft. However his interests and knowledge were diverse on this re-reading I'm drawn to his short chapter on Black-throated Divers nesting on a nearby island on the loch. Divers (= loons in North America) are notable for their exquisite breeding plumage and because they are an ancient lineage of birds (there is a Cretaceous fossil from Chile).

| Black-throated Divers (_Gavia arctica_) were observed by **Tomkies** nesting on Loch Shiel in the 1970s and 1980s but, according to ebird sightings, not now.  But they are widely seen in western Scotland and all around the UK as far south as Cornwall.

| Red-throated Divers (_Gavia stella_)  are the most primitive of the divers.  **Mike Tomkies** saw Red-throated Divers  visiting Loch Shiel in the 1970s and 1980s and they are still observed there (although small highland lochs are preferred for breeding).

There are 5 species of divers.  A couple of the others, the Great Northern Diver and the Yellow-billed Diver (both larger birds), are also seen in the United Kingdom but are less common.  The first phylogeny of the family, based on morphological data [Boertman, D. Phylogeny of the divers, family Gaviidae (Aves). Steenstrupia 16, 21â€“36.] had _Gavia arctica_ and _Gavia pacifica_ as sister taxa but that was rejected by a mitochondrial DNA study.  A recent next gen study [Sprengelmeyer (2014)](file:///home/robin/Downloads/sprengelmeyer_2014_gavia_phylogeny.pdf) showed that the  the morphological study had been correct.
