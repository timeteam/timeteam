<b>Mike Tomkies</b> 1984. _A Last Wild Place_. London: Jonathon Cape, 250 pp.

I must have first read this at least 20 years ago, and several times since - for the pleasure of the classic nature writing, based on wild animals and plants closely observed over many decades by **Mike Tomkies**, refugee from Hollywood who spent 19 years living on remote Loch .

A modern next gen molecular phylogeny of divers is recently available in the form of [**Quentin Sprengelmeyer**'s Master's thesis](file:///home/robin/Downloads/sprengelmeyer_2014_gavia_phylogeny.pdf).
