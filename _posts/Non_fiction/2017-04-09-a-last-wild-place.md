I must have first read this at least 20 years ago, and several times since - for the pleasure of the classic nature writing, based on wild animals and plants closely observed over many decades by **Mike Tomkies**, refugee from Hollywood who spent decades living in wilderness locations and writing about and photographing wildlife, including 19 years living in an abandoned croft at Gaskan (he called it 'Wildernesse') on Loch Schiel in western Scotland.   Much of  **Mike Tomkies**' field activities and writing in this and other books revolved around studying Golden Eagles nesting on cliffs above his croft. However his interests and knowledge were diverse. On this re-reading I'm drawn to his short chapter on Black-throated Divers nesting on a nearby island on the loch. 

Divers (= loons in North America) are notable for their exquisite breeding plumage and because they are an ancient lineage of birds (there is a Cretaceous fossil from Chile).  They are diving birds most closely related to grebes Livezey & Zusi, 2007) and hunt fish (mostly) in clear water by sight.  Doivers are capable of swimming submerged for at least a minute and (according to **Mike Tomkies**) to nearly 20 m depth.  It would be very nice to see one.

Black-throated Divers (_Gavia arctica_) were observed by **Tomkies** nesting on Loch Shiel in the 1970s and 1980s but, according to ebird sightings, not now.  But they are widely seen in western Scotland and all around the UK as far south as Cornwall.  The [RSPB map](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-and-wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/b/blackthroateddiver/index.aspx) shows Loch Shiel to be close to the southern limit of the summer range of this species, which as of 2017 is estimated to number at most 250 breeding pairs.

Red-throated Divers (_Gavia stella_) are the most primitive of the divers.  **Mike Tomkies** saw Red-throated Divers  visiting Loch Shiel in the 1970s and 1980s and they are still observed there (although small highland lochs are preferred for breeding). The [RSPB map](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-and-wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/r/redthroateddiver/index.aspx) shows the summer range of this species extends further south than does the Black-throated Diver, and includes northern Ireland.  The Red-throated Diver is much more numerous in the United Kingdom with about 1,600 breeding pairs in 2017.

There are three other species of divers, two of which, the Great Northern Diver and the Yellow-billed Diver (both larger birds), are also seen in the United Kingdom but are less common.  The first phylogeny of the family, based on morphological data (Boertman, 1990) had _Gavia arctica_ and _Gavia pacifica_ as sister taxa but that was rejected by a mitochondrial DNA study (Lindsay, 2002). A recent study using next generation sequence data (Sprengelmeyer, 2014) showed that the morphological study had been correct after all.
