<b>Mike Tomkies</b> 1984. _A Last Wild Place_. London: Jonathon Cape, 250 pp.

I must have first read this at least 20 years ago, and several times since - for the pleasure of the classic nature writing, based on wild animals and plants closely observed over many decades by **Mike Tomkies**, refugee from Hollywood who spent decades living in wilderness locations and writing about and photographing wildlife, including 19 years living in an abandoned croft at Gaskan (he called it 'Wildernesse') on remote Loch Schiel in western Scotland.   Much of  **Mike Tomkies**' efforts and writing in this and other books revolved around studying Golden Eagles nesting on cliffs above his croft. However on this re-reading I'm drawn to his short chapter on Black-throated Divers nesting on a nearby island on the loch. Divers (= loons on the other side of the Atlantic) are notable for their exquisite breeding plumage and because they are an ancient lineage of birds (there is a Cretaceous fossil from Chile).

| Black-throated Divers (_Gavia arctica_) were nesting on Loch Shiel in the 1970s and 1980s but, according to ebird sightings, not now.  But they are widely seen in western Scotland and all around the UK as far south as Cornwall.

A modern next gen molecular phylogeny of divers is recently available in the form of [**Quentin Sprengelmeyer**'s Master's thesis](file:///home/robin/Downloads/sprengelmeyer_2014_gavia_phylogeny.pdf).
