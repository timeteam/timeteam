Superficially this is a baseball book (with lots of jargon impenetrable to those not thus indoctrinated).  However it is also a narrative about bringing a revolution to a field. In this case the field is baseball, which as **Michael Lewis** tells it, is ruled by unsupported myth-based opinions of a club of old baseballers and the ignorant sycophant journalists who write about them.  In this story, the two principal characters **Billy Bean**,  general manager of the Oakland As<sup>1</sup> and **Paul DePodesta**, assistant general manager.  **Paul DePodesta** is the and manager and creator of the statistical data that enable the revolution in this book. The Oakland As have little money for players so  **Bean** and **DePodesta** just get the best baseballers (best as judged by what their statistics say about their performance).  Since these players are often "faulty" they come cheap ("faulty" = not photogenic, not marketable, not conforming to the old baseballers concept of what a young champion should look like and so on).  Thus the Oakland As won a lot of games on a budget a fraction of the big clubs, and ruffled many feathers in so doing.  Apparently they still do.  Anyone who doubts that  **Bean** and **DePodesta** were not revolutionaries needs to read an article by **Paul DePodesta** on [The Genesis, Implementation, and Management of New Systems](https://web.archive.org/web/20040206175549/http://www.csfb.com/thoughtleaderforum/2003/depodesta_sidecolumn.shtml) in which he quotes **Thomas Kuhn** at the end of the piece.

The reader gets to know a few of the characters in the book.  But what I cried out for was some more detail on the methods **Paul DePodesta** used to gather, manage and interpret his data.  A bit of a search failed to find anything, which may  mean there are sophisticated systems that no-one wants to talk about because of their commercial value.  Certainly that is the case now.  But in 2002 when this book was being written, I suspect that **Paul DePodesta** simply used spreadsheets. I would still have liked to know how he amassed so much dat from so many leagues and games around the USA.  Not by himself, certainly.  How all this was funded is never made clear.

Laughably, even the new wave of evidence-based baseball rationalists trying to turn the game upside down feel the need to invent a new word&mdash;"sabermetrics"&mdash;for statistics!  Although they are mostly outside the "club" of old baseballers and journalists they appear hell bent on creating their own club!  Petty criticism aside, an interesting read, and a quick one.

The book is exhaustively indexed.

<sup>1</sup>Throughout the book and seemingly everywhere else in the USA (including at the club itself) the Oakland baseball club is called the Oakland A's but I can't see how this can be either a contraction or possessive and I refuse to comply.
