A natural history of birds.  Has a bit of an old-fashioned feel but rich in information and in appeal. 



For example, the Cracraft tree has loons and divers (_Gavia_ spp.) grouped with albatross, petrels and penguins but the next generation sequencing study of [Prum et al](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282651425_A_comprehensive_phylogeny_of_birds_Aves_using_targeted_next-generation_DNA_sequencing/figures) instead has them plesiomorphic to a those but also to a host of others including pelicans, herons, cormorants etc.
