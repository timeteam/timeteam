A natural history of birds.  Has a bit of an old-fashioned feel (despite the recent publication date) but rich in information and in appeal. There are chapters on feeding, breeding, migration and an interesting chapter 'The Mind of Birds', but the most interesting to me were chapters
on the origin of birds, the complex evolutionary history of feathered  dinosaurs and hence the 'what is a bird?' question, and the detailed tour of the major groups of birds and their diversity world-wide.  A great overview, very helpful for someone who wants to give global context to their knowledge of a regional fauna.  Also good context for [**Tim Low**'s _Where Song Began_](https://www.timlow.com/books/bird-book) which is on the list...

(There is also a chapter on classifying, in which **Colin Tudge** demonstrates that he doesn't realise the rules of taxonomic nomenclature are not about personal preferences but are about priority, and thus stability.  But I'll get over that.) 

There are even two large fold-out cladograms at the end of the book, which largely summarise the view of bird phylogeny as presented in Figure 27.10 of **Cracraft** et al. (2003).  There is endless (and futile) scope for comparisons with later more robust analyses.  For example, the **Cracraft** tree has loons and divers (_Gavia_ spp.) grouped with albatross, petrels and penguins but the next generation sequencing study of [**Prum** et al., (2015)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282651425_A_comprehensive_phylogeny_of_birds_Aves_using_targeted_next-generation_DNA_sequencing/figures) instead has them plesiomorphic to a those but also to a host of others including pelicans, herons, cormorants etc. (As it happens, other hypotheses from earlier mitochondrial genes were not fully taken on board by **Cracraft** et al. but they were much closer to the **Prum** et al., (2015) next gen hypothesis.)

But it is all good, and **Tudge** is constantly acknowledging that everthing he says (and that scientists say) is subject to revision as knowledge improves.  As it has in the last 15 years, most of all in understanding of evolutionary relationships thanks to overwhelming evidence from DNA sequence data.
