An imagined year, 1250, in the life of Troyes, France, permanent population then about 10,000 and one of the biggest and richest in Europe. One of the "fair cities", made wealthy by the hot and cold fairs (summer & winter) bringing traders from far.  Infrastructure and insurance supported by the city.



The authors' choice of Troyes evidently made easy for the abundant original sources, freely quoted in their admirable writing style.  Two amateur historians (as they describe themselves) who cut just enough corners to turn their knowledge into prose both informative and very readable.   And writen in the present tense, which makes very immediate.
