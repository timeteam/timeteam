More  childhood autobiography than natural history.  Great writing and a well-conceived childhood memoir that is above all a record of the stumbling yet inevitable path that the author trod to become a professional natural historian.  Also a compelling history of early heart surgery in the United Kingdom as the author, long after the event, reconstructs his mother's medical journey and decline due to rheumatic fever and her surgery, successful for a time, thanks to a pioneering cardiologist and surgeon.
