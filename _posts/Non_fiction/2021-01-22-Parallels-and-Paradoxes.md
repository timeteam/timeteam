It isn't everyone who can say they played Prokofiev's Piano Sonata no. 2 to Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, let alone at age 11.  That's Barenboim though.  Edward Said's response ("no one's perfect") marks him as having at least a smidge of wit and self-awareness.

There is heaps of this kind of stuff.  But it is hard to pull off a book of conversations between intellectuals/musicians without it sounding like rounds of pretentious pocket-pissing.  The Murakami-Ozawa memoir had that too, although not in spades like this one.
