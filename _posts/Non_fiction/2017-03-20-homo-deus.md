This patchwork of a book is not nearly as interesting as it promises.  

The very first chapter, _The new human agenda_ sets the scene in a promising way with some cogent observations: "For the first time in history, more people die today from eating too much than too little ..."; "more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined ...".  We don't get exposed to the plan of the book until page 66 where it is explained that the first part is an attempt to understand if _Homo sapiens_ is special compared with other animals.  The second part is about "the bizarre world _Homo sapiens_ has created in the last millennia".  The final part is about our current "predicament" and possible futures and " ... scrutinises our smartphones, dating practices and job market for clues of things to come".  I should have read the tea leaves and stopped right there. 

Subsequent chapters and headings promise much but fail to deliver any substance: _Why the stock exchange has no conciousness_; _The time bomb in the laboratory_.  Some are downright silly: _Is Beethoven better than Chuck Berry_; _Electricity, genetics and radical Islam_.  **Harari** just goes on setting the scene for an interesting book, but he never delivers that book.  There are plenty of trite truisms, opinions and judgements which he hides from unconvincingly with the statement "... this is a historical prediction, not a political manifesto".  I should have been alert to the fact that **Yuval Noah Harari** is a historian  and so he naturally sees events through the prism of an ebb and flow of power and wealth as they work on and through cultures and civilisations.

I did enjoy _A brief history of lawns_ (pp. 61-64) where the author indulges in an amusing tirade on this gratuitous symbol of wealth, which started in palaces and chateaux and is now ubiquitous in the West in the form of suburban lawns, quadrangles, sports fields and the like.  (They never bothered with lawns at the Parthenon or the the Hidden City.)
