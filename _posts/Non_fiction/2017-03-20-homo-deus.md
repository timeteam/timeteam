<b>Yuval Noah Harari</b> 2016. _Homo Deus. A brief history of tomorrow_. London: Harvill Secker, 440 pp.

This patchwork of a book is not nearly as interesting as it promises.  

The very first chapter, _The new human agenda_ sets the scene in a promising way with some cogent observations: "For the first time in history, more people die today from eating too much than too little ..."; "more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined ...".  Subsequent chapters and headings promise much but fail to deliver any substance: _Why the stock exchange has no conciousness_; _The time bomb in the laboratory_.  Some are downright silly: _Is Beethoven better than Chuck Berry_; _Electricity, genetics and radical Islam_.
