A way of tasting a time and a place no longer attainable.  Just before World War 2 broke out, nine-hundred-plus miles, Venice to Peshwar through Iran when it was Persia, Afghanistan into India.  Vastly understated episondes where broken axles are nothing, peril incarceration illness tossed off with a stray word.  Many contemporary events and people are implicit.  As are the origins of British post-war attitudes to Israel and Palestine.  To later readers, Byron's acute wit and acerbic character assasination of Byron seems to presage Christopher Hitchens, even Basil Fawlty.  And yet a true naked celebration of Islamic culture and architecture. 

Joy in short sentences.
