Not as interesting as it should be.  A bit too much gratuitous invention in historical recreations, and as a result the content is thin.  An uneasy mix that also seemed a bit strained: early chapters say some things about papyrus in ancient Egypt -- boat making, papyri for writing (oldest known currently is almost 3,000 BCE, economy and ecology.  Subsequent chapters, the bulk of the book, are advocacy for wetlands with case histories from various African cultures.
