A little gem of natural history writing, easily and enjoyably read in a few evenings.  A mixture of moss natural history, snippets of research projects, personal stories, conservation issues, First Peoples cultural knowledge, all woven into a series of short chapters each with it's own identity and narrative.  Wonderful that such a book on mosses exists, and wonderful that it is appreciated so widely (2019 was the 14th printing, and there is often a queue for library reservations).  Much to be learned about mosses without even trying.
