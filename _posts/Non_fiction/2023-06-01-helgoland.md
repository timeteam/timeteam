In which Carlo Rovelli elucidates quantum mechanics, by narrating the history of the great theorists and their ideas.  Notable, as usual, for Rovelli's diversions into philosophy and literature.  Own copy required so as to be able to dip into the endnotes at leisure.

But, if science is a natural extension of the predictive model by which we see and are, supposedly, conscious, Rovelli again makes me wonder why he seems shy of the philosophy of Kant.
