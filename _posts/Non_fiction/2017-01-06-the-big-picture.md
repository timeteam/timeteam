***

**Sean Carroll** sets out to explain what we know about the nature of our physical world and, more importantly, how (what scientific and philosophical methods and investigations) have led us to that understanding.  The scope is therefore similar, for example, to **David Deutsch**'s [The Beginning of Infinity](http://timeteam.github.io/physics%20and%20mathematics/philosophy/2014/12/12/The-Beginning-of-Infinity.html) but lacking that book's exciting vision of what an infinite universe really implies.  To my mind, **Sean Carroll**'s treatment is too heavy on philosophy at the expense of the foundations of mathematics and physics for a book with this ambition. Nevertheless, there is, of course, plenty to learn, plenty to think about.  

### A quick summary of things I agree with, disagree with, and now want to learn more about:

  * I found **Nick Bostrom**'s simulation argument was dismissed way too glibly (p. 92).  
  * I'm keen to read about **Robert Aumann**'s proof as stated on p. 121: "two people, both acting rationally, who start with the same Baysian prior credences for their beliefs, and who have acces to the same information, including knowing what the other knows, cannot disagree about the updated credences for those beliefs".  A good place to start might be this [interview with **Aumann**](http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/hart/papers/md-publ-aumann.pdf)
  * (p. 137).
  * The discussion on pp. 146-148 of adjusting Bayesian priors as a way of updating our beliefs of beliefs (theism and atheism) is a nice way of summarising
