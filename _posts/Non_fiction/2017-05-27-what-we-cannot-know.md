**Marcus du Sautoy** is a mathematician and Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, a chair previously held by **Richard Dawkins**.

This book covers much of the same material found in other recent mathematics and physics books that aim to introduce general readers to the Big Questions.  However here the flavour here is interesting, emphasising what is not known (and cannot be known?) rather than what is known.  This material is arranged in 7 sections or "Edges", being Edges in the sense that these are the edges of what can be known in 7 different fields.

Edge 1 is about statistics, Chaos theory and chance events.  

Edge 2 is about fundamental particles and whether matter is infiintely divisible.  

Edge 3 is about quantum theory and perhaps what is reality.  Thus **Einstein**
> I don’t demand that theory corresponds to reality ... All I’m concerned with is that the theory should predict the results of measurement  
Waves vs particles, Schrodinger and quantum entanglement. 

Edge 4 is about the universe and is it infinite?

Edge 5 is about time.  Is _it_ infinite?

Edge 6 Consciousness.  Will it ever be understood or modelled or recreated as Artifial Intelligence?

Edge 7 is about mathematical limits, specifically Gödel's theorem (there are true statements that we can never prove to be true so long as we stay within the system).  And also Cantor on infinite sets.  I can't remember anyone else but **du Sautoy** converting this theorem to the statement that seems all too obvious: is it ever possible to understand a system of which we are part?  Of course this also applies to investigating consciousness.  If the universe is really a mathematical object (_sensu_ **Max Tegmark**) then (it seems to me) this is the crucial edge of knowledge and all the others are special case derivations.  

I don't think there is much here that is original and a fair bit is covered better by other authors (Edge 6 on consciousness, for example) but I always get something reinforced or explained successfully for the first time by hearing a new author tackle a subject.

There is a great review publishied in Physics Education (2017) **52**: 7-9 by [Peter Campbell](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/aa65b6/pdf)
