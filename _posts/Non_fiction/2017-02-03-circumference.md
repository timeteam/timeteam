Apparently not much is known of **Eratosthenes**. His original works are lost (due to the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, where he worked and became chief librarian). What is know of him is through third parties who copied or summarised parts of his writings.  That has not stopped **Nicolas Nicastro** putting together this short  book, more than somewhat frustrating in that only towards the end of the book does the author begin to address **Eratosthenes** and his celebrated and surprisingly accurate estimate of the circumference of the Earth.  Abandoning any attempt at suspense, the principal behind **Eratosthenes**' method is explained on pages 27-28 but the methods of measurement (and errors entailed) are not discussed until almost the final pages.  In between there is plenty of setting the scene, providing some context of Greek and Egyption history but although this is occasionally of slight interest it always feels like filler material which is there to turn an essay into a book.   Having waded through most of it, I sadly have to conclude that the [wikipedia page on **Eratosthenes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes)  is a quicker, more informative and far less frustrating treatment of the same material.

It seems that **Eratosthenes** was big on ratios and proportions as a way of investigating and explaining phenomena.  Thus his method: When the sun was directly overhead at Syrene,  **Eratosthenes** determined that it was about 7° away from vertical a known distance away at Alexandria. The ratio of 7°/360° must then equal the ratio "distance to Alexandria"/"circumference of the Earth". Depending on what assumptions are made about the modern equivalent of **Eratosthenes**'s unit of measurement (the stadion), the answer he got might have been somewhere between 1% and 10% of the accepted value (~40,000 km).  Although the insight of **Eratosthenes** is unquestioned, there is no evidence in this book that the subtitle " ... the ancient quest to measure the globe" is anything but a grandiose misnomer.  Suirely there was no such quest.  More likely the commonly-held quests were to get a decent feed and not get butchered by a visiting army.       

Although not mentioned at all in this book, **Eratosthenes** was also a significant mathematician and developed among other things an algorith ("the Sieve of Eratosthenes") for finding prime numbers.  **Eratosthenes** was a contemporary and friend of **Archimedes** and certainly one of the great minds of his day.  If his works had not been destroyed no doubt he would be recognised and for much more than the circumference of the Earth achievement.  **Eratosthenes** deserves a better biography than this, one with less of a focus on geodesy.

The bibliography is reasonably extensive.
