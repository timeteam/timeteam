Apparently not much is known of **Eratosthenes** all of his original works are lost; what is know of him is through third parties who copied or summarised parts of his writings.  That has not stopped **Nicolas Nicastro** putting together this short  book, more than somewhat frustrating in that it barely touches on **Eratosthenes** and his celebrated and surprisingly accurate estimate of the circumference of the Earth.  The principal behind **Eratosthenes**' method is explained on pages 27-28 but the methods of measurement (and errors entailed) are not discussed until almost the final pages.  In between there is plenty of setting the scene, providing some context of Greek and Egyption history but although this is occasionally of slight interest it always feels like filler material which is there to turn an essay into a book.   Having waded through most of it, I sadly have to conclude that the [wikipedia page on **Eratosthenes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes)  is a quicker, more informative and far less frustrating treatment of the same material.

It seems that **Eratosthenes** was big on ratios and proportions as a way of investigating and explaining phenomena.  Thus his method: When the sun was directly overhead at Syrene,  **Eratosthenes** determined that it was about 7° away from vertical a known distance away at Alexandria. The ratio of 7°/360° must then equal the ratio "distance to Alexandria"/"circumference of the Earth". **Eratosthenes** certainly demonstrated great insight but there is no evidence in this book that the subtitle " ... the ancient quest to measure the globe" is anything but a grandiose misnomer.  There was no such quest.  More likely the commonly-held quests were to get a decent feed and not get butchered by a visiting army.
