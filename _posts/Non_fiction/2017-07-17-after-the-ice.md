<b>Steven Mithen</b> 2003. _After the Ice. A global human history 20,000-5,000 BC._  London: Wiedenfield & Nicholson, 622 pp. 

This is a vast survey of the global archaeological record of human settlement through the Holocene, but because the book was written before the discoveries at the Ness of Brodgar (where the dig started in 2006), there is precious little on my immediate interest, the Neolithic record in the Orkneys.   I've only read the first ~200 pp, which is mostly accounts of sites in Western Asia followed by  Northern Europe, but the Scotland component is mainly about where **Steven Mithen** has himself worked, in the Hebrides. 

**Steven Mithen** alternates the telling his story through the device of an imaginary first-person visitor to the sites which archaeologists know from digs.  It sort of works for a while, but soon seems dreadfully dated and self-indulgent.   Nevertheless, there is a lot to learn, and the extensive endnotes and bibliography are great.

Here is a chronology of some of the settlements chosen by **Mithen** for his account, plus some dates from recent work in the Orkneys from [Orkneyjar](http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/timeline.htm).  Also a few other dates as points of reference:

* 20,000-12,300 BC - _Ohalo_ on the Sea of Galilee.  Hunter-gatherers with temporary "settlements" of earth and wood huts.
* 17,000 BC - neolithic paintings in the [_Font-de-Gaume_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font-de-Gaume) in the Dordogne.
* 13,200-12,400 BC - _Gough's Cave_ in southern England.  Evidence for cannibalism.
* 12,300-10,800 BC - _Ain Mallaha_ and other eastern Mediterranean sites where _Natufian_ culture has been found.  First evidence for more permanent settlements and crop domestication.
* 11,000 BC - By now humans are living throughout southern England.
* 10,800-9,600 BC - Younger Dryas drought and cold: crop failures forced people to abandon settlements, at least in the Levant, and return to being nomadic hunter-gatherers.
* 9,700-8,500 BC - _Jericho_ in the Jordan valley. More benign climate returns and Neolithic humans raise crops again.
* 9,250 BC - _Cramond_, Endinburgh.  As of 2003 the oldest date for a settlement in Scotland. 
* 7,500-6,400 BC - Rising sea levels submerge Doggerland beneath the North Sea and cut off Britain from Europe.
* 3,800 BC -	The _Knap of Howar_ occupied on the island of Papa Westray.  Oldest Orkneys date?
* 3,400-3,100 BC - Earliest structures at the _Barnhouse_ Settlement, Orkneys.
* 3,300-3,200 BC - Earliest structures built on the _Ness of Brodgar_, Orkneys.
* 3,200 BC - Early buildings at _Skara Brae_, Orkneys.
* 3,100 BC - _Stonehenge_ phase 1.  Earthen ring.
* 3,000-2,900 BC - _Standing Stones o' Stenness_ constructed, Orkneys.
* 2,900-2,750 BC - _Barnhouse_ Neolithic settlement abandoned, Orkneys.
* 2,800-2,700 BC - _Maeshowe_ tomb  constructed, Orkneys.
* 2,700-2,500 BC - Pyramids of Egypt.
* 2,600-2,500 BC - Construction of _Ring of Brodgar_.
* 3,000 BC - _Stonehenge_ phase 2.  Cemetary and Aubrey holes.
* 2,550 BC - _Stonehenge_ phase 3.  Stone henge.
* 2,200 BC - _Skara Brae_ abandoned.
* 1,900 BC - _Temple of Knossos_ built.  Crete.
* 1,400-1,300 BC - _Temple of Knossos_ destroyed.
* 610-546 BC - _Anaximander_.  Miletus, Turkey. 
* 570â€“495 BC - _Pythagoras_. Samos, Greece
* 470-399 BC - _Socrates_. Athens, Greece.
* 432 BC - _Parthenon_ built.  Athens.
* 43-410 AD - Roman occupation of England.
* 79 AD - Eruption of Vesuvius destroys Pompeii and Herculaneum.
 

Other parts of this thick book deal with Asia, the Americas, Australia and Africa.  Maybe I'll get to bits of those one day. 

It seems that **Steven Mithen**'s other books are not so tempting after all.  From my browsing they seem to all be more opinionated and less evidence based: _A Prehistory of the Mind_ (1996), _The Singing Neanderthals_ (2005), _To the Islands. An archaeologist's relentless quest to find the prehistoric hunter-gatherers of the Hebrides_ (2010).
