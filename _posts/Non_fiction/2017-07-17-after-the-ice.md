<b>Steven Mithen</b> 2003. _After the Ice. A global human history 20,000-5,000 BC._  London: Wiedenfield & Nicholson, 622 pp. 

This is a vast survey of the global archaeological record of human settlement through the Holocene, but because the book was written before the discoveries at the Ness of Brodgar (where the dig started in 2006), there is precious little on my immediate interest, the Neolithic record in the Orkneys.   I've only read the first ~200 pp, which is mostly accounts of sites in Western Asia (settlements in the Levant, which bracket the drought and cold of the Younger Dryas: 10,800-9,600 BC, during which time crop failures forced people to abandon  settlements and drops and return to being nomadic hunter-gatherers).

This is followed by  Northern Europe, but the Scotland component is mainly about where **Steven Mithen** has himself worked, in the Hebrides. 

**Steven Mithen** alternates the telling his story through the device of an imaginary first-person visitor to the sites which archaeologists know from digs.  It sort of works for a while, but soon seems dreadfully dated and self-indulgent.   Nevertheless, there is a lot to learn.  Here is a chronology of the settlements chosen by **Mithen** for his account, with some more dates from recent work in the Orkneys added from [Orkneyjar](http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/timeline.htm):

* 20,000-12,300 BC - _Howar_ on the Sea of Galilee.  Hunter-gatherers with temporary "settlements" of earth and wood huts
* 12,300-10,800 BC - _Ain Mallaha_ and other eastern Mediterranean sites.  First evidence for more permanent settlements and crop domestication.

* 3800 BC (circa)	The Knap of Howar built and occupied on the island of Papa Westray.

3400-3100BC (circa)	Earliest structures at the Barnhouse Settlement.
3300-3200BC (circa)	Earliest structures built on the Ness of Brodgar site.
3200BC (circa)	Early buildings at Skara Brae.
3000-2900BC (circa)	Standing Stones o' Stenness constructed.
2900-2750BC (circa)	Barnhouse Neolithic settlement abandoned. Work begins on Barnhouse Structure Eight.
2800-2700BC (circa)	The chambered tomb Maeshowe constructed
2700BC (circa)	[Pyramids in Egypt]
2600-2500BC (circa)	Construction of Ring of Brodgar.
2200BC (circa)	The village of Skara Brae abandoned
 

Other parts of this thick book deal with Asia, the Americas, Australia and Africa.  Maybe I'll get to bits of those one day.

It seems that **Steven Mithen**'s other books are not so tempting after all.  From my browsing they seem to all be more opinionated and less evidence based: _A Prehistory of the Mind_ (1996), _The Singing Neanderthals_ (2005), _To the Islands. An archaeologist's relentless quest to find the prehistoric hunter-gatherers of the Hebrides_ (2010).
