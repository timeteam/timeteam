<b>Steven Mithen</b> 2003. _After the Ice. A global human history 20,000-5,000 BC._  London: Wiedenfield & Nicholson, 622 pp. 

This is a vast survey of the archaeological record of human settlement through the Holocene, but despite that, there is precious little on my immediate interest, the Neolithic record in the Orkneys. No doubt this is because most of those discoveries, especially the epic site at Ness of Brodgar, were made after this book was written.
