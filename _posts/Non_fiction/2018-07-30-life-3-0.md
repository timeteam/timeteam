A lightweight exploration of AI and the future of humans with way too many discussions of scenarios to be of enduring interst.  Much of the ground is already covered elsewhere, especially by Nick Bostrom.

It has it's moments, though, for example early on there are a few pages on "what is computation?": an entity/intelligence/conciousness/program has no way of knowing what substrate/operating system it is running on.  I'm not sure if Max has thought this through - he asserts that this is a corollary of Turing's proof of universal compuation.
