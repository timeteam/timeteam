There are many encouraging review of this around, but to my own animal mind, this book about consciousness in animal minds failed to deliver much in the way of insights (this despite the author giving an interesting interview with Robyn Williams recently).  Peter Godfrey-Smith makes a lot, too much, of being a SCUBA-diving philosopher - a lot of the book is a survey of the animal kingdom, especially as seen by divers, and with many anecdotes from the author's diving experiences.  This makes for an easy read, but very little of it is relevant to the stated aim of the book, to address  "animal minds and the birth of consciousness". The survey of the invertebrate part of the animal kingdom takes up the first third of the book in a way that would be useful for novices in the field of invertebrate biology and evolution.  And there is some very basic material on consciousness research including Descartes and "what is it like to be a bat".  The most interesting discussions are those on dreaming, and oon possible parallel consciousnesses in octopus with their distributed nervous system.  The rest is very general, easy to read but not offering much novel.  For me the author aimed at too broad an audience and hasn't challenged his readers enough.

The endnotes, however, provide a rich trove of further reading, quite a bit of which _does_ address "animal minds and the birth of consciousness".
