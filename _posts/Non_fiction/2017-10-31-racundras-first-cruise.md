<b>Arthur Ransome</b> 1956. _Racundra's First Cruise_. Hammondsworth, Middlesex: Penguin Books, 158 pp.

***


A sublime cruising yarn and a pure joy to read and re-read, much of it written by the author at his writing desk on _Racundra_ while on this Baltic cruise.

The crew of Racunda comprised a most interesting trio:
"The Cook" throughout the book but known to be Evgenia Shelepin, who was Trotsky's secretary and would become Ransome's wife.  
"The Ancient" (an allusion to the Ancient Mariner), Carl Sehmel, a Captain from the Clipper Ship era. 
Arthur Ransome himself, who had moved to Russia in 1913 as journalist and writer and became (or already was?) a strong sympathiser of the Bolsheviks.  Ransome was under investigation from MI5 from 1917 as a possible Russian spy but it seems equally possible he was gathering information for the British.  MI5 didn't lose interest in him until 1937.  

Much of this information, about which Ransome was coy, can be found at http://arthur-ransome.wikia.com/wiki/Arthur_Ransome_Wiki
