This witty book is also deceptively informative and a joy to read.  It also has the flavour of something that **Bill Bailey** could have written rather quickly.  Except that it is the kind of book that could have only have been written by someone who has spent decades observing birds.  So not "rather quickly".  Probably it was a rather longer project in the writing too, although I read it in a couple of evenings despite intending to dip into species by species according to mood (probably how it was written?).  

**Bill Bailey** has selected 51 British birds to write about, and each gets a few pages of writing and some idiosyncratic **Bailey** sketches.  (There are about 600 species on the UK bird list and the [RSPB Guide](http://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-and-wildlife-guides/bird-guide/) currently has 259 species.
