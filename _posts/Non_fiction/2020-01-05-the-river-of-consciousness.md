Oliver Sacks' final collection of essays, published after his death.  Among other things they function as a sampler to his other books, many of which are referenced.

I didn't know Sacks was such a student of Darwin but here many of Darwin's  six plant books are discussed, mainly in terms of the careful edifice of evolutionary examples which Darwin uses to build a fort around his theory of evolution by natural selection.  

The essay _The Creative Self_ has some excellent examples (Henri Poincar√©, Wagner) of the phenomenon where problem solving continues as an "incubated" process in the subconscious mind.

But I found the essay on _The Other Road: Freud as a Neurologist_ most rewarding.  I didn't know that Freud spent a substantial part of his career working on hardware before moving to software (developing psychology).  And that memory and motive are essentially the same thing - there can be no remembering unless there is a motive to do so.  Further developed in the subsequent essay _The Fallibility of Memory_.
