This huge meal of a book is a rich history of the roads connecting Rome, Constantinople with Persia and the far East.  An antidote to the Jewish and Christian bias of Sapiens, and a great companion to the history of the "Dark Ages" by **Michael Pye** and also **Richard Fiddler**'s recent history of Constantinople.  

So rich that the detail sometimes obscures the wider picture and I found it necessary to skip back and forth to secure a new context.  Not even sure if these are the major points to extract.  I think it is a book that requires  familiarity with the material to appreciate fully. 

The early chapters are about the ebb and flow of Christianity and other religions (Buddhism, Zoroastrianism), especially in Constantinople and Persia.  The adoption of Christianity by Rome who pushed it east led to a reaction against such evangelising.  Nevertheless in the centuries before the rise of Islam Christianity was in a strong and seemingly expanding position from Constantinople to Persia and with many outposts beyond (Samarakand and further east, north oof the Aral Sea).  But then (540s AD) bubonic plague devastated populations (10,00 deaths per day in Constantinople) and the survivors were not well disposed towards either rulers or religions.  This seems a central part of the book although it is related in the early chapter, _The Road to Revolution_, where the author shows that  the revelations and teachings of Muhammad, from 610 AD onwards fell on ears receptive to revolution, since cities and populations had been suffering from both plague and from the long-running Roman-Persian wars.  Thus Muhammad was able to unite many pagan and polytheistic Arabian tribes under a new monotheistic religion, Islam.  The early Islamic period saw rapid expansion during the years 628-632 AD, including into Jerusalem which had only recently (614 AD) fallen to Persia (the Romans accused the Jews of assisting the Persians in taking Jerusalem).  It was during this brief period that "Persia", previously a disparate group of tribes, became united Arabs under Muhammad. 
 
Important to recognise, states **Frankopan**, that Islam, Christianity and Judaism were mutually supportive  during the early Islamic period.  Islam and Judaism were especially close, both venerating Abraham (Ibrahim) as prophet and repudiating Jesus the Mesiah.  Early co-operation, respect and acceptance of alternative monotheistic faiths, although stated in the Qu'ran, is long since discarded, tragically.
