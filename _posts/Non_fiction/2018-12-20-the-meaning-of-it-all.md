This little book contains the text of 3 lectures given by Feynman in April 1963 by invitation (the John Danz lectures).  The titles of the lectures are the three chapter titles, which are indication enough that they remain relevant:

1. The uncertainty of science
2. The uncertainty of values
3. This unscientific age



The full text of the lectures is, I now discover, [available online](http://search.chadpearce.com/home/BOOKS/8773894-Meaning-of-It-All-by-Feynman-Nobel-Laureate.pdf)
