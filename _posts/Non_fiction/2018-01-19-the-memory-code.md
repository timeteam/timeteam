Lynne Kelly's thesis is that memory - of environment, landscape, history, dates, astronomy, food and so on - was crucial in prehistory and all successful societies.  And, those societies would have used the 'memory cathedral' technique: linking knowledge to landscapes (Aboriginal Australian cultures), megaliths (Neolithic Europe), glyphs in the desert (Nasca), sculptures (the moai of Rapanui), and many kinds of hand-held mnemonic devices in many cultures.  Among others.    

The argument is plausible, even compelling in parts, but is weakened by the impression rapidly gained by the reader that every prehistoric landscape, monument and artefact encountered by the author had the primary purpose of being a mnemonic aid.  This cannot possibly be so.  There is also too much of the first person-journey of discovery type of narrative.  

On the positive side, the author certainly seems to be onto something that prehistorians have largely overlooked, and this is the main thing after all.  This is yet another example of the advances that can be made when someone outide a field brings something new from a different domain.   And, even if the overlay of mnemomic interpretation is removed, the book still functions well as a very readable and current summary of archaeological knowledge of the many prehistoric societies that she surveys. 

This is a popular version of the author's PhD thesis, published as _Knowledge and Power in Prehistoric Societies_ 2015, Cambridge University Press).
