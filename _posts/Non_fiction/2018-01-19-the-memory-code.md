<b>Lynne Kelly</b> 2003. _The Memory Code._  Sydney: Allen & Unwin, 318 pp. 

Lynne Kelly's thesis is that memory - of environment, landscape, history, dates, astronomy, food and so on - was crucial in prehistory and all successful societies.  And, those societies would have used the 'memory cathedral' technique: linking knowledge to physical objects in landscapes (Aboriginal Australian cultures), megaliths (Neolithic Europe), glyphs in the desert landscane (Nasca), sculptures (the moai of Rapanui), and many kinds of hand-held mnemonic devices in many cultures.
