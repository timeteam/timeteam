Apparently I'm the only one who didn't warm to Helen Macdonald's _H is for Hawk_ (too much Helen, too little hawk).  Essays suit her better though - especially the title essay on swifts.  Many essays have nothing to do with birds but many of these are also good, notably the one on planetary geologist Nathalie Cabrol.
