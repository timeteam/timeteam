This cathedral of a novel is built stone by stone, each of them embellished in full detail - many times one wishes not.  I think I first read this in 1978 but unfortunately wrote nothing then; wonderful to revisit but this time I found it harder going than Tolstoy, Melville or Patrick White and won't be reading it a third time (although I think the original experience resulted in seeking out the Artur Schnabel recordings of the late Beethoven sonatas).  The considerable effort required to read this is already rewarded just by the description of Beethoven's Opus 111 sonata, as well as the often momentary digressions on many other works along the way.  Just as memorable are the descriptions of non-existent works by the barely ficitious composer Adrian Leverk端hn (although perhaps not, Leverk端hn is evidently based on Schoenberg but I don't know if the fictitious works are partly inspired by particular works). The biographical narrator is Leverk端hn's life-long reliable but pedestrian (viola player!) friend Serenus Zeitblom.  So much is alluded to, on friendships, free will, creativity, art and more but the central narrative makes it clear that Adrian Leverk端hn is only superficially Schoenberg, essentially he is the German  nation made culpable for the Second World War.
