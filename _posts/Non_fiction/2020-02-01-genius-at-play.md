Probably the best maths book imaginable to show close to the world mathematicians explore, and for which "reality' is perhaps just an approximation, or one possible iteration. A very good book is memorable because of the new worldthe reader is exposed to. This then is a very very very good book because it is a remarkable matematiciian talking about his long productive life working on many remarkable mathematical disciplines, and written by a very good biographer who herself totally in command of the mathematical concepts. You would not want to miss reading this.
[insert remarkable quotre on 296 about Conway's personality pathology]
almost as a postscript, the book towards the end revolves around Conway's Free Will Theorem, based on 3 axioms from quantom mechanics and which proves mathematically (if the axioms are accepted) that bopth particles and humans have free will and that these are essentially the same quantity, in that actions/behaviours are not determined (fully) by past events.
yet elsewhere (p. 379) the ever contrary Conway is happy to assert that "there are other ways of finding the truth than p;roofs" . Channelling Godel.
also bit about ~ God does geometry and the Devil algebra
