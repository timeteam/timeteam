A vast detailed book,too much so (for me) to read cover to cover.  Rather a reference book and sufficiently well illustrated (very many early maps generously illustrated), indexed and referenced to function as such.  As with many subjects, the early chapters on origins and early developments seem the most interesting.  In this instance the rather abstract Babylonian cuneiform tablet maps, various possible maps in prehistory, and the story of Al-Idrisi (Arabic diacritics omitted), map-maker and researcher to Robert II, King of Sicily, in the 12th Century.  Several other books recently read cover this ground (eg Violet Moller's _The Map of Knowledge_) - the treatment here is more detailed but less fluent.  I only read these first 2 chapters thoroughly but might return to the others if interest awakens.  They do not just treat Gerard Mercator but other earlier folk and topics:  the religiously oriented _Mappamundi_, Diego Ribeiro.    Most of all I'll borrow this again to read chapter 4, "Empire" on China and the Kangnido World Map circa. 1389-1402.
