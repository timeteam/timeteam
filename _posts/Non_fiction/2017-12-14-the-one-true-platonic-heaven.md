It is not clear what advantage the author hoped to achieve by inserting gratuitous invented dialogue into a history of a key period in the development of quantum mechanics.  For example, who would find an account of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paper is improved by pretending that Einstein's wife might have said to him 

> You need a rest, Albert.  I've brought you a nice glass of warm milk and a biscuit. ...

There are dozens of far better places to look on non-fiction shelves for accounts of what Einstein, GÃ¶del, von Neuman et al. at did at Princeton.  George Dyson's [Turing's Cathedral](http://timeteam.github.io/mathematics%20and%20physics/technology/2017/08/17/turings-cathedral.html), for one. This book has nothing to offer other than being very short.
