The first chapter is autobiographical, the third a brief history of recorded music.  The second, _Chacona, Lamento, Walking Blues: Bass Lines of Music History_ is the thread that runs through the whole book, an original history of modern (Western) music traced from dance music of 16th century Spain and Peru ("music of the devil" according to contemporary report) to folk laments, to the Blues.  Everything is in here, nearly.  It isn't the sort of thing I've ever seen attempted but there must be others, although surely none so concise, well written.  Lacking such breadth of listening it is hard to judge, but not hard to enjoy and learn from it.  Much supporting info including the author's lectures and other supporting information including audio are at [the author's web site](https://www.therestisnoise.com/listentothis/).

Every re-reading of this great book initiates a whole lot of re-listening too, seeking out new recordings.  This time Clifford Curzon recording of Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 which I had somehow missed until now, even though Barry Jones also put it at the top of his Brahms recommendations in _The Shock of Recognition_. 

Also on the author's web page is news of his next book [Wagnerism](https://www.therestisnoise.com/2013/05/wagnerism.html); rush to get that when it comes out in Sept 2020.
