<img align="right" src="http://images.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9781400075997" alt="">  Rich and detailed account of the building of [ENIAC](http://ethw.org/ENIAC), the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer.  But also a history of the first years of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, and of **John von Neumann** and his colleagues, who, because they invented digital computing, also had to develop programming.  They invented hacking, or at least were more or less independent developers, depending on where one places **Babbage**, **Lovelace** and **Turing**.   

There are many enduring conclusions from this wonderful book.  For example, when Nazi Germany purged universities of their best academics it ensured the military, technological and economic dominance of the USA henceforth (or at least up until now).  These mathematicians and physicists (**Albert Einstein**, **John von Neumann**, **Kurt Gödel**, **Edward Teller**, **Stanislaw Ulam**, **Eugene Wigner**) were welcomed as refugees at Princeton and built the first digital computer in order to perform calculations verifying the design of the atomic bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  In so doing, they created the USA's nuclear weapon dominance, and also led directly to the technological and economic dominance of IBM, RAND and then silicon valley. (If one were to set up an equivalent to the Institute for Advanced Study now, would it be so easy to choose key researchers?  Geneticists, physicicts and researchers studying the brain, consciousness and artificial intelligence would have to be vital.  But who?  The [Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/) seems one attempt at a modern equivalent and good luck to them.)
    
Refugee academics are not the only pricipals in this book; **Abraham Flexner** and **Oswald Veblen** had arguably the most formative role of all, founding and funding the Institute for Advanced Study and recruiting this academic dream team.  Thanks to visionary leadership and philanthropy there seemed no problem recruiting others who rapidly became famous as well: **Freeman Dyson**, **Richard Feyneman**, **Claude Shannon**.  And **Alan Turing** himself, who also visited.  And who better than **Freeman Dyson**'s son **George Dyson** to write the history? He grew up at Princeton among these remarkable people.  



Another enduring message from this book is that the scientists who concieved of ENIAC and first implemented digital computing knew very well the wider and longer term implications of what they were doing.  Documents unearthed by  **George Dyson** show that  **John von Neumann** and others saw many of the places that digital computing would lead: simulation, virtualisation, modelling, AI.

Is time, space and the universe fundamentally digital (as asserted by **Anaximander**, **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** and quantum loop gravity theoreticians such as [**Carlo Rovelli**](http://timeteam.github.io/mathematics%20and%20physics/2017/07/03/reality-is-not-what-it-seems.html)? **Kurt Gödel** was perhaps the person among all these thinkers who best deserved the adjective original;  **Gödel** spent a lot of his final years researching the writings of **Leibniz** who pioneered binary arithmetic and the his own view that the universe was digital.  Few shared **Gödel**'s views, then or now, but **Leibniz** did have a medallion <img align="right" src="http://jams.ucpress.edu/content/ucpjams/68/1/151/F1.large.jpg?width=800&height=600&carousel=1" style="width: 30%; height: 30%" alt="medallion struck in 1697">  struck in 1697 illustrating the creation of all things by means of binary arithmetic.  It seems the simulation argument goes back further than I realised. 

A truly great book, about an incredible time in the history of science and of the West.  Richly documented with endnotes, mostly from unpublished sources from the archives of the Institute for Advanced Study and from the personal documents of the protagonists.
