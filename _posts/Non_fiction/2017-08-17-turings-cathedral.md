<img align="right" src="http://images.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9781400075997" alt="">  Rich and detailed account of the building of [ENIAC](http://ethw.org/ENIAC), the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer.  But also a history of the first years of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, and of **John von Neumann** and his colleagues, and of programming (hacking).   


Maybe the two enduring conclusions from this wonderful book are that when Nazi Germany purged universities of their best academics it ensured the military, technological and economic dominance of the USA henceforth.  These mathematicians and physicists (**Einstein**, **John von Neumann**, **Kurt GÃ¶del**, **Edward Teller**, **Stanislaw Ulam**, **Eugene Wigner**) were welcomed as refugees at Princeton. 

**Abraham Flexner** and **Oswald Veblen** had arguably the most formative role of all, foundiung and funding the Institute for Advanced Study and recruiting this academic dream team.
