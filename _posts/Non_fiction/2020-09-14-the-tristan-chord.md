To get a trivial negative out of the way first, Bryan Magee takes delight in correcting many misconceptions folk have of Wagner; it becomes a minor flaw of this indispensable book that he is so easily diverted towards shooting down in flames those who misunderstand Wagner, especially those who pontificate from a state of ignorance.  

The young Wagner had an impeccable cv as a left wing radical Marxist, hanging out with Bakunin, manned the barricades, exiled to Switzerland, lived in poverty (which hasn't stopped his reputation being kidnapped by those of opposite political persuasion).  And during this period wrote his first operas, and at an age even Mozart would have found precocious.   

Philosophically Wagner turned from anarchists, especially Proudhon to Hegelians especially Feuerbach (philosophical materialism; gods don't create humans, humans create gods), then finally to Kant and especially Schopenhauer. In contrast, despite close association, according to Magee Marxism (dialectic of perpetual change; property is theft) and Nietzsche (too young) influenced Wagner hardly at all.  

The chapter The Philosophy of Schopenhauer is as good a summary as one could want of Schopenhauer (and Kant). And as short - 20 pages.  Schopenhauer disagreed with Kant's noumenal as a plural entity, and also rejected Kant's causal relationship between phenomenal and noumenal.  Thus for Schopenhauer phenomenal and noumenal are one entity, one reality, with the noumenon is the inner.  And that music has a unique access to expression of the noumenon.

But, The Ring traverses Wagner's discovery and adoption of these ideas. The Ring libretto dates from Wagner's young revolutionary period, although his conversion to the philosophy of Schopenhauer caused Wagner to find new and different meaning in  the work, he realised this as a new music and left the libretto unchanged.  (Wagner did write, and discard, an explicit Schopehhauer ending - see p. 181.) 

So the last half of The Ring, and Tristan, Mastersingers, Parsifal, are where Wagner fully reasied Shopenhauerian philosophy in the form of his highest art and Schopenhaer's avowed most powerful medium: music.  Hence the heart of the book is the chapter Metaphysics as Music, and the culmination of complete art form (opera) is for Wagner (and for Bryan Magee):

> giving expression to ultimate metaphisical insight, a thoroughly possessed hilosophical vision of the totality of what there is - than which, if it is valid, nothing could go deeper. (than Parsifal, that is, p. 212; also elaboration of the Schopenhauerian expression in Parsifal, p. 273, p. 283) 

Further, the title, The Tristan Chord 

> contains within itself not one but two dissonances, creating in the listener a double desire, agonizing in its intensity, for resolution. The chord to which it then moves resolves one of these dissonances but not the other, thus providing resolution-but-not-resolution. It is not until we reach the opera’s closing notes that the chord finds resolution (Magee page ref missing)

> The idea that the pursuit of exercise of power is incompatible with love and the capacity fo love is basic to the Ring.  If one thought were to be singled out as the work's kernel it woule have to be this.  (bottom of p. 113)   

On improvisation (p. 233; 236-237) the most desirable thing (says Wagner) is for a work of art to partake of those qualities - freshness, freedom - and fix them in permanent form.  As he did in the rush of writing Tristan.

According to Wagner's own words Bryan Magee notes tantalisingly that if he had lived longer his works would have been symphonies (one act symphonies, like Sibelius 7?), or maybe a Budhist-inspired opera on which Wagner had made notes throughout his life.

A handy little summary of Wagner's life, with a narrative of compositions and philosophical turning points is hidden on pages 11-14.  Nevertheless, the book darts around chronologically as Magee follows his arguments to the extent that a chronology would be handy.  Here is mine (not all of these moments are needed for Magee's arguments):
