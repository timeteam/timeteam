Somewhat interesting but doens't do justice to his subject.  Byron and Babbage take up much of the book, with a cameo by Ada Lovelace towards the end.  James Essinger knows a lot about his subject but this turns into an overly familiar style that I didn't warm to.  I'll be reading elsewhere to learn more about Ada herself.
