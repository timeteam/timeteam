Great read of a multi-decade project to return an uneconomic Sussex farm to nature. Thanks to Pete Jacobs for the loan and for escalating this on my in-tray.  Lots to learn from this.  Lasting impressions are the realisation that conservation strategy in the UK is distorted by a Victorian-era agrarian view.  And that you have to have land and independence to tackle projects like this, as well as vision.  And that finding a long list of expert advisors has been so important.
