My 1972-1973 high school maths notebook is evidence that I once understood the basics of this subject.  Sadly no longer, but if I could have read this book then it may have made me wise enough to maintain that knowledge.  Steven Strogatz has no trouble convincing the reader that of the importance and the rationale, but following the mathematical proofs I understood 46 years ago is another matter.  But that is my failing not that of the author.

To me most interesting for ... 
... explaining how Archimedes (~287â€“~212 BCE) came so close to integration with his brilliant method for approximating pi, circumference and the area of a parabolic segment.  Tellingly, Strogatz shows that Newton was taught this material in school (p. 187-).  
... the reminder that Galileo qualifies as the first scientist for his experiments,  seeking causes.
... for showing how the geometry approach to mathematics (of the Greeks) and the algebraic method from the Islamic mathematicians was brought together by Fermat and Descartes, what a mongrel Descartes was, and how close Fermat came to discovering calculus (pp. 93-113).
