Wonderfully well conceived, researched and written.  At once a survey and celebration of seabirds in 10 chapters.  Fulmar - 
Puffin - Kittiwake - Gull - Guillemot - Cormorant and Shag - Shearwater - Gannet - Great Auk and its Cousin Razorbill - 
Albatross.

...

I'm trying, and failing, to think of a natural history book that is as interesting and as enjoyable to read.
