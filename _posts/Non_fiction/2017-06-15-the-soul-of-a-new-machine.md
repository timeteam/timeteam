A ripping yarn from the early days of computing with solid state electronics, about how Data General had urgent need of a 32 bit minicomputer to remain competitive with VAX and put together a team  to build it in 1978-1980 (well, 2 competing teams; this is the story of the team that succeeded).  I think I first read this in the early 1980s, fairly soon after it was published.  Monash University was using VAX computers, not DG.  **Ronald Reagan** was about to be elected President, **Bob Dylan** has just recorded _Desire_ and is about to go gospel, and a year later IBM releases the first PC. ARPANET was running but a functioning internet was 10 years away.  I was in London when  _Richmond_ whips _Collingwood_ to win the VFL premiership (which it hasn't won since).  

The book was a richly-deserving Pullitzer Prize winner and an instant cult classic to both computer geeks as well as business management.  Nearly 40 years later it is still in print and equally enjoyable to read, even though the technology of course is now unrecognisable.  **Tracy Kidder** knew nothing about computers when he started this project but (or therefore) explains the arcane elements of the microcode that controls computer hardware without shirking the detail and with great clarity.  Even those majority of readers who, like me,  who don't need to know this stuff enjoy reading it.   His narrative of how the teams (hardware and software) were put together and interacted is even more compelling. Management schools apparently still use this as teaching material and it would be ideal, there are plenty of positive as well as negative features of the team and how it was managed.  Surely the overriding lesson is that you have to have a small team of good people, selected by people who know how they are going to have to work together.  Then try and protect them from the Forces of Darkness.

[Science Friday](https://www.sciencefriday.com/) (no longer just a book club) has a  [YouTube interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wq3ucqnaSk) with three of the engineers from the project.  It doesn't say much that isn't in the book but it is very nice to see them speak about the project and their affection for project leader and engineer **Tom West**, who died in 2011.
