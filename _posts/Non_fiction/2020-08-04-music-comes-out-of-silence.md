A book in two portions: the first shorter part is a transcript of conversations with journalist Martin Meyer; the second part collected writings, including a number of texts written as sleeve notes accompany recordings.  I learned a lot from the first part, for example about Hungary's unhappy recent history (with it's  own "Stalin"), about how hard András Schiff worked to be so wonderful a pianist, about how good and well-trained is his memory, about Haydn and Beethoven, about how many great musicians hail from Hungary.  A great companion to his master classes.  The second part -- Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Hungary again prominent - tends to be a bit didactic (the earlier conversations reveal a more gentle András Schiff) contains much that needs to be read alongside the music. And a great education for when and when not musicians should transcribe Bach without making musical folly.
