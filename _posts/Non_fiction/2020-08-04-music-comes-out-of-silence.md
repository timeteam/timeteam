A book in two portions: the first shorter part is a transcript of conversations with journalist Martin Meyer; the second part collected writings, including a number of texts written as sleeve notes originally published with his recordings.  From the first part I learned things I should already have known, for example, about Hungary's unhappy recent history (with it's own Stalinist dictator), about how hard András Schiff worked to be so wonderful a pianist, about how many great musicians hail from Hungary.  The second part -- Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Hungary again prominent - tends to be a bit didactic (the earlier conversations reveal a more gentle András Schiff) contains much that needs to be read alongside the music. And a great education for when and when not musicians should transcribe Bach without making musical folly.  A great companion to his master classes.   

It is no news that András Schiff is a great musician, but it was wonderful to learn that he lives in the hills around Florence and (discovery from an interview elsewhere, at Verbier), that he loves and loves to tell jokes, and that in another life he might be a labrador.  Anyone of sound mind would also love these three things, and more of András Schiff.
