***
This book about the brain and how it works was written by the brain of **David Eagleman**.  How far is it possible to get with a method like this?  Neither **Eagleman**, nor anybody else in neuroscience or AI seems to address this question.  Would we expect a dog to be able to be able to understand how the dog works?  A blue whale?  An orangutan?  What makes us think we can pull it off? 

Anyway, 
Recently acquired in the same theme but not yet read, this book by another researcher in the same group:

**Roberto Pieraccini** 2012.  _The Voice in the Machine_.  Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press Books. 325 pp.
