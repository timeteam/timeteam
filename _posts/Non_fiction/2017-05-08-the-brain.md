This book about the brain and how it works was written by the brain of **David Eagleman**.  How far is it possible to get with a method like this?  Neither **Eagleman**, nor anybody else in neuroscience or AI seems to address this question.  Would we expect a dog to be able to be able to understand how the dog works?  A blue whale?  An orangutan?  What makes us think we can pull it off? 

Nevertheless, even though there isn't anything original in this, it remains most interesting and well put-together, more so than the documentary series written in parallel with the book.  (Mind you, that is just my brain saying so.  What would it know?)  

The early chapters focus on learning about the brain through pathologies: 
* Social interaction is vital to brain development: hellish social oppressions prove this, as does the incredible fact that synmaples are formed in infants at the astronomical rate of two million _per second_.  the number of synapses peaks at about age two and are reduced to the "useful" ones as we age.
* A small tumour in the wrong spot can turn a normal person to murder (perhaps smaller, as yet undetected physical defects are responsible for other social pathologies, turning normal people into politicians, for example?  Or taxonomists?).  
* Memories are fallible: the brain will construct false memories to provide a convincing back-plot to a fictional story that someone has been convinced really happened (and, _this even works on a researcher studying the very same phenomenon_). 
* Brain excercise protects somewhat against degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease (this one widely reported in recent years). 


Hopefully by writing this out my brain will remember a bit about what it learned about how brains (including itself) remember stuff, including stuff about other brains.  Or at least what it thinks it learned.
