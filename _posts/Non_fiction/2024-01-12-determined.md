Despite being already in agreement with Robert Sapolsky that there is no such thing as free will, I found myself unable to mount the willpower to finish this.  Too much Sapolsky, too little brevity and clarity.  And way too much on long-winded expositions of his ongoing debates on the subject with Daniel Dennett.  

There is a whole chapter on what seems a major hole in the determination argument: the butterfly effect (maybe unpredictability of outcomes from minor chemical/physiological peturbations makes it seems like we have free will?).  Sapolsky says no, but does it with impenetrable verbosity.

This book has attracted a number of gushing reviews so maybe I just wasn't in the right frame of mind. But see John Martin Fischer at the [Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews](https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/determined-a-science-of-life-without-free-will/).

Looking forward to these issues being taken up by someone who is not being paid by the page.
