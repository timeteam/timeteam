> I suffer from a terrifying non-selective memory that haunts me.

This from a pianist who could learn and memorise Book I of the Well-Tempered Clavier in 4 days, who had 80 concerts committed to memory.   (Be careful what you wish for, says he that writes these notes mainly as a backstop against a poor memory.)

On the other hand, I've read elsewhere that Richter reputedly had the entire Western piano cannon of the past 200 years in his head, but he makes it clear in the converstations with Bruno Monsaingeon recounted in this book that such is not the case.

The first half of this book is the transcript (and more) of Bruno's film; the 2nd part is Richter's notes on performances, works, recordings, composers & musicians. Much guidance to be found especially for Prokofiev and other Russian music, but opinions need qualifying with his remarkable preference for wartime Leningrad under bombing with frozen bodies in the street (""the city was beautiful, mysterious ... "). When he returned after the siege in 1945 he was "Nauseated'" to find a mood of exhilaration "utterley banal".
