<img align="right" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SOHRRObyL.jpg" alt="">    The subject is interesting but the writing is all over the place, unstructured (there are chapters but they have cryptic titles and I'm still not sure what most were about), full of irrelevant observations and anecdotes, with no compelling narrative or development.  The section on the Apollo program was an exception - interesting and informed, as was the nice summary of the current theories on the formation of the Moon (planetary collision).  Otherwise in large part unrewarding. There are plenty of references throughout to the science fiction literature.
