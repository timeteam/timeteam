A little gem of a book comprising brief and engaging biographies of the surprising number of significant mathematicians who were born in Ireland. Chronologically arranged, starting with Thomas Harriot (1560-1621) who despite lacking algebra developed a method for plotting a compass course on a map projection (and also kept his head despite having a political nature and living in the time of Sir Walter Ralegh and Guy Fawkes).
