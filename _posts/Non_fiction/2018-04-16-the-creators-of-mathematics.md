A little gem of a book comprising brief and engaging biographies of the surprising number of significant mathematicians who were born in Ireland. Chronologically arranged, starting with Thomas Harriot (1560-1621) who despite lacking algebra developed a method for plotting a compass course on a map projection (and also kept his head despite having a political nature and living in the time of Sir Walter Ralegh and Guy Fawkes).    I had no idea that so many prominent mathematicians were Irishmen (no women): William Rowan Hamilton (Hamiltonian methods which I don't understand but are now used in quantum mechanics, optics, fluid dynamics etc.); George Boole (Booleian logic); Lord Kelvin (William Thomson); Osborne Reynolds (Reynolds numbers in fluid dynamics, etc); and significant statisticians including Francis Ysidero Edgeworth and William Sealy Gosset.

To a non-mathematician it seems that this collection is a little patchy in quality, perhaps (for example only some chapters have references to original or more comprehensive sources).  Something like John Stillwell _Mathematics and its History_ would be much more authoritative.  But it is an enticing read with most chapters containing interesting historical and personal context.
