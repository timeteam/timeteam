<b>Michael R. Canfield</b>  (*editor*)  2011. _Field Notes on Science and Nature_  Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.  297 pp. *UniM BioMed 570.72 FIEL*

Twelve chapters by a authors who are decidely at the naturalist end of the spectrum of scientists.  The chapters tend to be repetitive pleas for more field researchers to maintain field notes and sketches of chosen study organism. As was done much more frequently in a more gentle bygone era.  Among other weaknesses

By far the best element of the book is this quote from the Foreword by **E.O. Wilson**:

> *If there is a heaven, and I am allowed entrance, I will ask for no more than an endless living world to walk through and explore.  I will carry with me an inexhaustible supply of notebooks, from which I can send reports back to the more sedentary spirits (mostly molecular and cell biologists). Along the way I would espect to meet kindred spirits, among whom would be the authors of the essays in this book.*

It is a generous comment; although the chapter authors include some well-known identities, none are in **E.O. Wilson**'s league.  Indeed that is a lasting regret from the volume: the writings of **E.O. Wilson** are almost unique, at least in the modern era, for their ability to incorporate field notes of the sort repeatedly advocated herein into a body of rigorous, original and highly readable science.  I could have done with a substantial contribution from **E.O. Wilson** on this topic.
