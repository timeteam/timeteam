<b>Kazuo Ishiguro</b> - _The Buried Giant_

What is it about?!  A parable about forgetting and memory.  Several author interviews [] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_MpnJ4belI suggest individual memories and cultural forgetting are the focus. However as a devotee of the UK popular archaeology program _Time Team_, it seems to me that _The Buried Giant_ is just as easily read as a parable of society emerging from a pre-rational state to a more rational, more objective, condition where memories are more to be trusted.  Perhaps.
