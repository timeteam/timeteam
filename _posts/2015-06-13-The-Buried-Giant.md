<b>Kazuo Ishiguro</b> - _The Buried Giant_

What is it about?!  A parable about forgetting and memory?  In at least one interview [youtube plugin not working yet] the author tells us that individual memories and forgetting are the focus. However as a devotee of the UK popular archaeology program _Time Team_, it seems to me that _The Buried Giant_ is just as easily read as a parable of society emerging from a pre-rational state to a more rational, more objective, condition where memories are more to be trusted.  Perhaps.

Among my top 5 novels of all time  (1, 2 and 3 would be by <b>Patrick White</b>; 4 might be _Cannery Row_).
