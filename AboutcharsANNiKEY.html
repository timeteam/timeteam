<P>About the characters</P>

</B><P>POLiKEY contains 329 characters of which xxx are morphological and the remainder deal with biology, ecology and ancillary information. The morphological characters are divided into seven groups based on major body regions, as follows:</P>

<OL>

<LI>general features;</LI>
<LI>head and head structures;</LI>
<LI>foregut, pharynx and jaws;</LI>
<LI>body segments and parapodia;</LI>
<LI>branchiae;</LI>
<LI>chaetae and aciculae;</LI>
<LI>tube and burrow</LI></OL>


<P>Character selection and wording has by necessity been a compromise between expressing features simply for the beginners wanting to identify specimens, and phylogenetic accuracy, for advanced users wanting to interrogate the system. In general, the individual character states of each character represent different expressions of a single ancestral feature (i.e. character states are homologous). When this approach resulted in potential confusion we sometimes combined unrelated states together under the same character. This made the character easier to use and interpret especially for the novice. For example, the character describing the multiple jaw elements of the anterior gut contains three homologous states (different arrangements of maxillae), and a fourth unrelated state (form of multiple jaws, either macrognath or micrognaths). </P>

<P>For an illustrated introduction to the character set, and for users wishing to work with subsets of characters, either for interrogation or identification, select:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Characters from the top-level Browsing menu (Advanced mode only), or</LI>
<LI>‘Use a subset of characters’ button in the Characters (left-hand) pane (Normal or Advanced modes). </LI></OL>


<P>Selecting subsets of characters may be useful for identification. For example, palaeontologists or fish biologists who may need to identify polychaetes from fossilised or gut remains should select the ‘hard part’ character subset. This can be done using either of the two methods above.</P>
