<P>Using POLiKEY</P>
</B>
<P>POLiKEY can be used for both identification and information retrieval (i.e. interrogation, or query of the data set). The 'Start' button in the top-level menu activates both. This button clears any information entered in previous identifications/interrogations and displays the best characters to use in the identification/interrogation. In addition, quick identification can be achieved using the top-level menu button, ‘?Quick’.</P>

<P>The program operates in two modes: Normal and Advanced. The Normal mode opens automatically, but you can switch to Advanced mode in the File menu. In Normal mode, POLiKEY works using only the toolbars; <B><I>the Normal mode should be used for identification</B></I>. In Advanced mode the full menu system and the command line are activated. The full menu system provides options for interrogating the database and is therefore the preferred mode for information retrieval; <B><I>the Advanced mode should be used for information retrieval</B></I>.</P>

<P>Help is provided in both Normal and Advanced modes using the ‘?’ button at the far right of the top-level toolbar; simply click on the ‘?’ button then click on the button for which help is required. A full help menu, including the DELTA Intkey manual and a description of IntKey commands, is provided under the Help menu in Advanced mode.</P>

<B><P>Identification</P>
</B>
<P>Identification is performed in Normal mode.</P>

<P>After first clicking on the ‘Start’ button to clear previous information use the top-level buttons to select:</P>

<OL>

<LI>taxonomic level required: click the <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#68;</FONT>
 button for higher level taxa (above family), or on the <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#209;</FONT>
 button for families and generic groups;</LI>
<LI>biogeographic region (or regions) of interest;</LI>
<LI>major habitat (or habitats) where your specimen occurs.</LI></OL>


<P>Then click on your character of choice from the list in the characters (top left) pane, and select the character state (or states) that match your specimen. Identification proceeds by progressively eliminating taxa that do not exhibit the selected character state(s). Eventually you will end up with a single taxon, at which point you can confirm your identification by clicking on the ‘i’ button in the Taxa (right-hand) pane. This will activate a window having taxonomic and biological information on the selected taxon. Line drawings and colour photos can also be viewed in this window.</P>

<P>When doing a quick identification using the ‘?Quick’ button you should first activate the ‘All Taxa’ button (top-level menu) because the characters used in quick identification apply both to family-level and higher taxa. The quick identification characters are grouped into different regions of the body; each diagnoses a single taxon, and therefore identifications can be achieved in a single step. This is a quick and effective way of identifying a polychaete that appears to be particularly distinctive in one or more ways. Note that the buttons for biogeographic region and habitat type are not available when using quick identification.</P>

<B><P>Information Retrieval</P>
</B>
<P>Information retrieval is performed in Advanced Mode (accessed via File menu).</P>

<P>After first clicking on the ‘Start’ button to clear previous information you can perform several types of interrogations are possible:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Under the Browsing menu, information (including images) on characters and taxa can be accessed;</LI>
<LI>Under the Queries menu information on descriptions, diagnoses, differences and similarities of selected taxa can be accessed. In addition a summary of the data set can be generated. </LI>
<LI>The top-level menu button, ‘Specified Attributes’ allows you to find taxa having a specified set of attributes;</LI>
<LI>Differences between two or more taxa can be found by selecting the taxa in question in the Taxa (right-hand pane) either by clicking on the taxon (or multiple taxa can be selected by holding down the Shift and/or Control keys while clicking), or by clicking on the ‘Use a subset of taxa’ button. Then click on the ‘Differences between taxa’ button.</LI></OL>
