</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>POLiKEY is an interactive key and information retrieval system for polychaete families and higher taxa. It is underpinned by a DELTA database (Dallwitz 1980; Dallwitz, Paine &amp; Zurcher 1993) containing 104 taxa and 135 characters. The information system comprises an interactive identification program, based on Intkey (Dallwitz, Paine &amp; Zurcher 1995), general information, taxonomic descriptions, illustrations for each taxon (more than 200 line drawings and colour photos of living polychaetes and museum specimens), illustrations for each character (over 300 colour-enhanced line drawings), a glossary of technical terms, and a comprehensive bibliography. It allows the user to obtain:</P>
<OL>

<LI>identifications of adult polychaetes from any part of the world to family or higher taxonomic level;</LI>
<LI>diagnostic and full descriptions of families and higher taxa;</LI>
<LI>general information on biology, further reading, and automated Web searches for all families and higher taxa;</LI></OL>

</B>
<P>POLiKEY began as DELTA database of 95 characters and 82 family-level taxa prepared by Kristian Fauchald in 1995. The original data set has been substantially revised and updated to reflect the enormous amount of work that has been published in recent years. The primary additional data source, including illustrations, for POLiKEY is Beesley, P.L., Ross, G.J.B. &amp; Glasby, C.J. (eds) 2000. <I>Polychaetes &amp; Allies. The Southern Synthesis</I>. <I>Fauna of Australia Vol 4A. Polychaeta, Myzostomida, Pogonophora, Echiura, Sipuncula</I>. CSIRO Publishing : Melbourne. xii + 465 pp. Data for the few families that were not treated by Beesley, Ross &amp; Glasby (2000) were drawn from Rouse &amp; Pleijel (2001), and this reference was also used as a basis for classification above family level and for family authorities. </P>

<P>Disclaimer</B>:</P>

<P>POLiKEY is designed to work for adult, sexually unmodified individuals. POLiKEY may not be able to identify highly modified sexually mature individuals of some families (e.g. Syllidae), which often bear little resemblance to unmodified members of their family. Fortunately, incidences of these forms in benthic surveys are usually rare.</P>

<P>Also, very early juvenile stages of some groups may not be identifiable with POLiKEY, especially those groups that undergo strong ontogenetic changes associated with cephalisation (e.g. Hesionidae). </P>

<P>Finally, there are sure to be errors in the database, and perhaps better characters to use for identification. We welcome comments on ways to improve the system. </P>

<P>Future versions and development</P>
</B>
<P>This is the first release of POLiKEY. Future versions of POLiKEY will be enhanced by provision of full listings of polychaete genera and species of the World through a Web link to the Polychaete Nomenclator database of Kristian Fauchald, and access to the Web version of Beesley, P.L., Ross, G.J.B. &amp; Glasby, C.J. (eds) 2000. <I>Polychaetes &amp; Allies. The Southern Synthesis</I>. <I>Fauna of Australia Vol 4A. Polychaeta, Myzostomida, Pogonophora, Echiura, Sipuncula</I>. CSIRO Publishing : Melbourne. xii + 465 pp.</P>

<P>POLiKEY will be integrated together with interactive keys to world genera, and species of Australia in the CD-ROM publication <I>Polychaetes: Interactive Identification and Information Retrieval </I>(by<I> </I>R.S. Wilson, P.A. Hutchings and C.J. Glasby, eds) to be published in 2002 by CSIRO Publishing, Melbourne. </P>
