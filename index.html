      		<p><i>There is little point reading an entire library if you have forgotten all about the aardvark by the time you get to the abalone.</i> &mdash;Nick Bostrom 2014 <i>Superintelligence</i>

                <p>This site is mainly intended as my own memory aid, to document to my future self what I found interesting in what I have read, and in so doing, to hopefully improve my memory of it.  Content includes some fiction including science fiction but more non-fiction, especially science-related.</p>

	<p>The first of these pages were created in November 2015 but post dates are the date I first read the book, not necessarily the date the file was posted.  Some dates are speculative (books on the in-tray).  Some are as yet empty, to be gradually filled from emails and other historical sources. Titles followed by an asterisk are empty placeholders with reviews yet to be entered.</p>
			
		<p>Notes on books and reading are arranged chronologically under the <a href="/archive.html">reading journal</a> and by notional <a href="/category">category</a>.
