      		<h1>Robin Wilson's books and reading</h1>
<p>This site is mainly intended as my own memory aid, to document to my future self what I found interesting in what I have read, and in so doing, to hopefully improve my memory of it.  Content includes some fiction including science fiction but more non-fiction, especially science-related.</p>
			
			<p>Content as yet is scant and is located under the <a href="/blog/categories.html">Readings link</a> and, soon, under <a href="/topics">Topics</a>.
