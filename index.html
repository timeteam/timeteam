      		<p><i>There is little point reading an entire library if you have forgotten all about the aardvark by the time you get to the abalone.</i> &mdash;<a href="https://timeteam.github.io/blog/2016/04/08/Superintelligence">Nick Bostrom 2014 <i>Superintelligence</i></a>

                <p>This site is mainly intended as my own memory aid, to document to my future self what I found interesting in what I have read, and in so doing, to hopefully improve my memory of it.  Content includes some fiction including science fiction but more non-fiction, especially science-related.</p>
			
		<p>Content as yet is scant and is located under the <a href="/blog">Readings link</a> and, soon, under <a href="/topics">Topics</a>.
