<p><b>Michael Harris</b> 2015. <em>Mathematics Without Apologies. Portrait of a problematic profession</em>.  Princeton: Princeton University Press. 438 pp.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is rare to find a book with no redeeming features, but this is one.  A fatuous, self-indulgent, undisciplined, unstructured and uninformative stream of conciousness from a professor of mathematics whose students are to be pitied.  Or rescued.  After a hundred pages of pointless drivel, and a skim through some random later pages, I gladly gave up.  Even the extensive list of references had barely 5 items I felt worth reading.  Four I already own.  There are plenty of warning signs I should have been alert to before purchase: The chapter “How I Acquired Charisma”. The first sentence of the Preface: “When this book was nearly done and my colleagues started asking me what it is about, I found it simplest to answer that it’s about how hard it is to write a book about mathematics.”  The repeated chapters revisiting the theme “How to explain number theory at a dinner party”.  The absence of any notable modern mathematician or mathematics commentator among the promotional blurbs.  A more accurate title would have been  <em>Self-portrait of a problematic mathematician (apologies: no mathematics within).</em></p>

<p>It is clear that, whether or not he is aware of it, <strong>Michael Harris</strong> had a readership of one in mind: himself.</p>

<p>I would give the book away but there is no-one I think so poorly of.</p>
