<B><P>About the Taxa</P>
</B>
<P>ANNiKEY contains 166 annelid taxa, comprising one higher-level taxon (order Myzostomida), 138 families, 22 subfamilies, 2 tribes and 3 genera. Myzostomida are easily recognisable at the order level, but somewhat difficult to identify to family. Please see the Remarks section in the Myzostomida description for details of literature having family-level keys. The subfamilies, tribes and genera were included because they are, arguably, more easy to recognise than their family counterparts. </P>

<P>Users wishing to work with subsets of taxa, either for interrogation or identification can select the appropriate subset in either of two ways:</P>

<OL>

<LI>from the top-level Browsing menu under Taxa (select Advanced mode under File), or</LI>
<LI> by the ‘Use a subset of taxa’ button in the Taxa (right-hand) pane (Normal or Advanced modes). </LI></OL>


<P>For further information on all taxa in the dataset, a url link to WoRMS (https://www.marinespecies.org/) is provided in each taxon description.</P></FONT></BODY>
