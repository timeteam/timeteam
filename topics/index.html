	<p>The first of these pages were created in November 2015 but post dates are the date I first read the book, not the date the file was posted.  Some dates are speculative (books on the in-tray).  Many are as yet empty, to be gradually filled from emails and other sources. 
	
	Site to-do list includes adding: categories or tags for better indexing; search facility.
	
	
	<ul class="topics">


	  {% for topic in site.topics %}
	    <li><span>{{ topic.date | date_to_string }}</span> Â» <a href="{{ topic.url }}" title="{{ topic.title }}">{{ topic.title }}</a></li>
	  {% endfor %}
	</ul>
